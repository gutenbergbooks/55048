<p class="noindent">
DEAR GENERAL SMITH-DORRIEN,
</p>

<p>
When, some few months ago, you honoured
me by your acceptance of this dedication I had
in mind to make a single volume which should
trace the course of the War during the period of
your command of the Second Army, the
unforgettable days from Mons to Ypres.
</p>

<p>
Since then I have found that there is one
phase of the operations which has gripped the
imagination of the public more than any other
event of the past two years: the "Retreat from
Mons."  It is, indeed, almost incredible how little
the people know of this, and how splendidly they
respond to the telling of the story.
</p>

<p>
But it seems to me that the story can never
be told as it should be.  Only those who actually
experienced the horror and the splendour of those
ten days could hope to tell it, and for them the
facts are blurred and distorted by the nightmare
through which they passed.
</p>

<p>
Still, I am rashly making the attempt, and in
doing so I try to write of the big, human side of
things.  For it is the trivial, homely incidents
in the daily life of the British soldier, and the
stories of noble devotion and chivalry of gallant
gentlemen like Francis Grenfell and Bradbury,
which fire the imagination.  I know that you will
understand and appreciate my motives.
</p>

<p>
For the rest, should the public be kind to this
trivial volume I shall hope later to continue the
narrative as I had originally intended.
</p>

<p>
Will you, then, accept my book, not in tribute
of a Command which must remain indelibly scored
in letters of gold on the page of our country's
history so long as Britain endures, but as a memory
of the two or three years of peace when I was
privileged to work with you and of the year of
war when I had the honour of serving, one of that
"band of brothers," in your Command?
</p>

<p class="noindent">
I am,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very faithfully yours,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. CORBETT-SMITH.<br />

AUTHOR'S ACKNOWLEDGMENT
</p>

<p>
I tender my very grateful thanks to GENERAL SIR
HORACE SMITH-DORRIEN for his kindness in reading
the proof-sheets of the book and for several most
valuable items of information.
</p>

<p>
My thanks are also due to CAPTAIN C. T. ATKINSON,
of the Historical Section, Committee of
Imperial Defence, for his courteous help in the
task of compiling the Roll of Honour.  Also to
the SECRETARY, K.A. Institution, for the loan of
material for the same purpose.
</p>

<p>
I have availed myself to some extent of the
researches of MR. HILAIRE BELLOC in my estimates
in Chapter V.; while my details of the German
Army are taken from German sources, "Deutsche
Land- und Seemacht," by Rabenau, and other
volumes.
</p>

<p>
To my comrades-in-arms (few, alas! remain),
whose deeds and experiences have contributed to
the writing of the story, I hold out a hand of
greeting.  I salute in reverence the immortal souls
of the gallant dead.

CHAPTER I
<br />
MOBILISATION
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Now all the youth of England are on fire,<br />
  And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies;<br />
  Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought<br />
  Reigns solely in the breast of every man.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
August 5th, 1914!  "Who would have
dreamed of such a thing!" exclaimed the big
majority.  "So it has come at last," said the
small minority.
</p>

<p>
Broadly speaking, there you have the
country's opinion during those now dimly
remembered days which followed immediately
upon Germany's throwing down of the gauntlet.
</p>

<p>
Officers and men of our once-upon-a-time
professional Army did not bother very much
about it either way.  War was their job.
Active service was to be welcomed as a picnic
change from the monotony of soldiering in
England.  Also, to the man keen on his
profession (and since the Boer War such men have
been steadily increasing in numbers) it meant
the chance of promotion and of showing what
he was made of.
</p>

<p>
A war, even long foreseen, must inevitably
come as a surprise when it does actually break
out, and this one was no exception.  During
the last week of that July there were very, very
few in Aldershot who felt certain that the hour
was at last striking.
</p>

<p>
But Aldershot was ready for it.  For many
a long year past Aldershot had existed for the
Army.  Latterly it had been the forge where
Britain's little striking force, the spear-head of
her armies, had been welded, sharpened and
tested, made ready for instant launching.  So,
with the Fleet, were we prepared to fulfil our
pact with France; or, if the summons came,
to stand by Belgium.
</p>

<p>
Aldershot existed for war, and the comings
and goings of troops passed almost unnoticed.
True, it now became increasingly difficult to
find rooms in the town, and the local outfitters
promptly set to work to reap a golden harvest
from the fantastic prices which they put upon
war gear of all kinds, but that was all&mdash;at least
to the eye of a casual observer.
</p>

<p>
There was Fritz, the doyen of Aldershot
hairdressers.  I wonder how much he learned
in those days of the movements of units.  Fritz
had been an institution in the camps when
present-day G.O.C.'s, grizzled and weather-beaten,
had, as junior subalterns, sought his
advice upon the training of incipient
moustaches.  Fritz remembered them all, could
instantly reel off details of their careers, their
regiments or stations, from the time they had
left Aldershot until they had returned in senior
commands.  All duly pigeonholed in Berlin
together with seemingly trivial incidents in
their private lives.
</p>

<p>
Later on, sometime at the Aisne, rumour
came round that Herr Fritz had been up to
mischief of a more serious nature and that he
had been duly lodged in prison, or shot, or
something equally suitable.
</p>

<p>
Those were happy if very strenuous days at
Aldershot that week or so before the embarkation.
Men talked very little about the future,
everyone was really too busy.  Thoughts
naturally flew back to the South African War when
they did talk.
</p>

<p>
"Nobody was particularly keen on that,"
was the generally expressed opinion; "nobody
wanted to kill the Boers; too one-sided.
This&mdash;oh! this is the real thing.  We've got our
work cut out."
</p>

<p>
The very day after the mobilisation the
Officers' Mess showed signs of packing up.  It
reminded one so much of the third act in <i>The
Second in Command</i>.  Two notices in the hall
brought things home:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Officers may wear Service dress or blue
undress jackets in Mess."
</p>

<p>
"Officers are particularly requested to pay
their mess bills before leaving."
</p>

<p>
Packing-cases and parcels began to drift in
and lie about: dozens of telegrams passed in
and out: a smaller variety of dishes appeared
at luncheon and dinner: the regimental band
came and played to us every night (the cheerier
spirits all took a hand at conducting, especially
rag-time).
</p>

<p>
Everybody had his job, and nobody knew
what anyone else was doing.  Right at the
beginning we experienced a curious feeling of
secrecy.  You would see an officer at lunch
and miss him at dinner.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes!  I believe he has gone this afternoon,"
someone remarks.
</p>

<p>
"When are you off?" Colonel X. would
say to an officer in a moment of forgetfulness,
hastily adding, "No, I don't want to know&mdash;but,
mind you pay your mess bill before you go."
</p>

<p>
This secrecy of movement was certainly the
most striking feature of those early days: that,
and the splendid organisation.  We have got
accustomed to it since, but at the time, and
to men used to the happy-go-lucky methods
of this dear, lovable, muddle-headed old
country of ours, that organisation struck one
as amazing.
</p>

<p>
On August 5th every C.O. was handed a
file of documents.  In these were given the
most precise directions as to times, places and
dates when his unit was to leave Aldershot.
For instance:
</p>

<p>
"Train No. 463Y will arrive at siding B at
12.35 A.M., August 10th.
</p>

<p>
"You will complete loading by 3.40 A.M.
</p>

<p>
"This train will leave siding C at 9.45 A.M.,
August 10th.
</p>

<p>
"You will march on to the platform at
9.30 A.M. and complete your entraining by 9.40."
</p>

<p>
And I believe it is a fact that every train
left five minutes ahead of its scheduled time.
The London and South Western Railway was
given sixty hours in which to send to Southampton
350 troop-trains.  They did it in
forty-five hours.  "Some" hustle!  The astonishing
efficiency of it all, and the admirable
co-operation between military and civil authorities.
I very much doubt if there were more than
two officers of the Staff at Aldershot H.Q. who
knew details of the intended movements.  Fritz
must have been annoyed.  C.O.'s, and other
individual officers, who knew when their own
unit was timed for departure, entered splendidly
into the spirit of the game and loyally kept the
information to themselves; would not even tell
their people, nor their best girls.
</p>

<p>
One day the King came down.  The visit was
as secret as everything else.  Each unit received
about a quarter of an hour's warning of His
Majesty's approach, and the men turned out
of their tents or broke off their work to line
up by the road.  A few words of "good-bye,
and good luck" to the men, a warm hand-clasp
to the officers, three cheers, and the Royal car
slipped forward to the next unit.  One could
hear the ripple of cheering flow round the camps
as His Majesty passed.
</p>

<p>
By the way, it is a little curious how, from
the very beginning, there have been just three
words used by everyone in bidding
"good-bye."  "Good-bye, and good luck."  A kind
of spontaneous, universal formula.  Officers
used it, the men, mothers, wives and sweethearts.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Good-bye, and good luck" to our sailors<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(It's a big debt we owe you to-day),<br />
  "Good-bye, and good luck" to our soldiers<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Some day we shall hope to repay).<br />
  Though anxious the hearts left behind you,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a tear from the eye seems to fall,<br />
  Yet&mdash;"good-bye"&mdash;God be with you, "good luck attend you,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good-bye, and good luck to you all"&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
as the refrain of a popular song had it later.
</p>

<p>
Impressions of those few hurried days are
blurred.  In a sense one had been through
it all many times before.  It differed but
little from moving station or preparing for
manoeuvres.  And yet there was something of
the glamour of an unknown future before one:
an instinctive feeling that this was the end of
soldiering as we had known it.  Not that
anyone dreamed of the war lasting beyond Christmas;
there are no pessimists in the Army.  We
were all at school breaking up for the holidays,
and I think that just about sums up the
situation as we saw it at Aldershot.  The unknown
future was more on the lines of "Shall we get
any skating?"  "Will there be some good
shows at the theatres?"  "What sort of fun
will the Pytchley give us?"  "Shall I be able
to get in the Hunt Ball?"
</p>

<p>
And so one has little enough to say about
the days of mobilisation and packing up.
Besides, quite enough has already been written
to satisfy an interested public.  One little
adventure, however, seems worth recording.
It befell a certain Gunner captain who was
detailed to conduct a draft of men from one
unit to another.  The yarn has the merit of
being true in every particular.  It may form
a small chapter to itself.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
A TOURING COMPANY
</p>

<p>
"Putting two and two together," said the
A.S.C. major, "I imagine that you're to take
this draft on to Portsmouth and hand over to
the O.C. of the company down there."
</p>

<p>
Why a Gunner captain should have to
conduct a draft of Field Gunners to a place like
Portsmouth and hand them over to the tender
mercies of an A.S.C. Company Commander, I
couldn't imagine.  Nor indeed why a Gunner
should take his instructions from an A.S.C. major
at all.  But the Divisional C.R.A. had
sent me up to him with the remark, "It looks
as though you ought to report there," and
that was all about it.
</p>

<p>
Mobilisation is responsible for a good many
queer happenings, and here at Aldershot on
the third day of it most men were rather at
sea.
</p>

<p>
Even in those few hours one had learned
not to ask questions.  There was no objection
to the asking, but the answer was usually a
vacant, far-away look over the shoulder and
"Eenteenth Brigade Office?  Oh, it's over
there"; and a wave of the arm would
comprehensively include Farnborough, Deepcut
and the Town Station.
</p>

<p>
And that was how the trouble began.  If
only the A.S.C. major had exercised a little
imagination and made five out of his addition
sum: if only he had read his own instructions
a little more carefully (although we didn't know
that till afterwards), a draft of tired Gunners
would not have spent the next week trailing
about the South of England looking for an
A.S.C. company which didn't want them, and
their officer would not have received a black
mark which nearly damned his future chances
at the very outset.  But that by the way.
</p>

<p>
"The men had their breakfast at three
this morning," and the cheery little subaltern,
who had brought the draft down from Newcastle,
saluted and discreetly made himself still
smaller by vanishing hastily round the nearest
corner.
</p>

<p>
I took my railway warrant and went out to
have a look at the draft.
</p>

<p>
A fresh-looking lot they were; young, most
of them, averaging about twenty-three years
old; special reservists the senior sergeant told
me.  The few old hands, who sadly needed a
shave and a wash, showed how young the rest
of them were.  I didn't take much stock of
them, then.  One doesn't when it's just a
conducting job of a few hours, handing over, and
back to Headquarters right away.
</p>

<p>
The men stood to attention, picked up their
kits, and, with a "Fours left," we were off to
the station down the shimmering, dancing,
sandy roads of the Aldershot camps.  The
A.S.C. major returned to his ledgers and more
arithmetic, and the cheery subaltern reclined
at lordly ease in a Gunner Mess arm-chair,
with a tinkling glass of gin and ginger beer
at his elbow, and discussed the striking results
of the previous day's battle in the North
Sea&mdash;which had not taken place.
</p>

<p>
The station-master, who didn't look as
worried as he felt, touched his cap.
</p>

<p>
"A local to &mdash;&mdash;, then change and go on
to Reigate" (was it Reigate?  I forget now,
one visited so many out-of-the-way places),
"and from there you'll probably get a through
train to Portsmouth.  If there isn't room in
the train you can always turn people out."
</p>

<p>
Visions of burly, homespun-clad farmers
and comfortable market-women being turned
out, protesting, by a mere Gunner captain
danced through my brain.  Actions for assault
and battery, damages, bail, prison.
</p>

<p>
"How an if they will not turn out?" said I.
</p>

<p>
And then I realised.  This was War, red
War; and Great Britain was mobilising.  The
needs of the State were paramount.
</p>

<p>
"You shall bid them turn out in the
Prince's name," and, unlike Dogberry, shall
see that you are obeyed.
</p>

<p>
And I made myself two inches taller
because after all a Gunner captain was
somebody in the world now.  And people looked
with a new interest at the lads in khaki and
began to realise, perhaps for the first time,
that they would have to count on the British
Army even though it were "such a little one."
</p>

<p>
To do the good folk justice there was never
a word of protest at the idea of having to turn
out.  And we had to invite them to do so a
good many times before the company finished
its tour of the Southern ports.  Really it might
have been a railway in Germany from the way
the civilians gave road to the uniform.  This
change of attitude was certainly a vivid contrast
to the days&mdash;last week was it?&mdash;when a man
in His Majesty's uniform was looked at askance
in crowded street and bar.
</p>

<p>
At Reigate, where we had to wait an hour,
a bombardier, one of the old hands, begged
leave to visit a certain hotel outside the station
to buy some bread and cheese.
</p>

<p>
He was a man who hardly gave the appearance
of being bread-and-cheese hungry, if you
quite take my meaning, and the glassy stare
with which this ancient tried to fix me augured
ill for discipline if there were many others in the
draft like him.  Permission was refused.  It
was a trivial point gained but it had its consequences.
</p>

<p>
Portsmouth was reached in some five
hours; and twenty minutes' march brought
us to the A.S.C. barracks where a hot dinner
would cheer us all; for I had remembered
to send a telegram <i>en route</i> to tell them to
expect us.
</p>

<p>
We were received with cordiality by a
decrepit old store-keeper, and the stables' cat.
Otherwise the barracks looked as though an
army had lately sacked the place from floor to
basement.
</p>

<p>
The men looked glum, and there was more
than a hint of a move to a near-by hotel for
"bread and cheese."  Well, they were only
young reservists and discipline was an almost
unknown quantity.
</p>

<p>
But dinner had to materialise somehow.
So, demanding the keys of the castle from the
unwilling seneschal, the senior sergeant, the
bombardier, the stables' cat and myself started
on a tour of inspection.
</p>

<p>
Good!  The kitchen contained a sack of
flour and most of a sheep.  Apparently the
sheep was intended to last the decrepit servitor
and his struggling family for the rest of the
week.  But we paid no heed to tearful
entreaties and ruthlessly tore the meat away from
their very mouths.
</p>

<p>
"This is War," said I.
</p>

<p>
Soon dinner was well on the way, blankets
were found for the men, and off I went to
report to Headquarters.
</p>

<p>
H.Q. "received me most politely," as
Harry Fragson used to sing, and didn't think
they wanted me nor my company for any
performance in Portsmouth.
</p>

<p>
"Come back to-morrow morning," said
H.Q., "and we'll tell you."
</p>

<p>
The next day.  "Oh, yes!" said H.Q.,
"you're Field Gunners, you're evidently sent
here for Hilsea (two miles out): you'd better
move on at once."
</p>

<p>
"Parade with kits in half an hour," I
ordered.
</p>

<p>
Merrily we marched forth from the castle
gates.  Were we not wanted at Hilsea?
</p>

<p>
A cyclist orderly threw himself, panting,
from his machine.
</p>

<p>
"H.Q.'s compliments and will you please
report there at once."
</p>

<p>
"Halt!  Fours about!  Quick march!"
</p>

<p>
H.Q. again received me most politely.
</p>

<p>
"No, you're not to go to Hilsea.  You've
evidently got to join the Eenty-eenth
A.S.C. Company which has gone on to Bristol.  You'll
just catch the 5.0 train if you're sharp."
</p>

<p>
"We're to go to Bristol," said I to the
senior sergeant, "and you've got to get a
move on or we'll miss the train."
</p>

<p>
"I've heard tell of Bristol," he ruminated;
"nice place, so my wife's cousin's husband
used to say.  He did tell as how&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But I cut the soliloquy short and got the
draft out of the castle again.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later peaceable citizens fled
into doorways and up courts, electric cars pulled
up short with a grinding of brakes, policemen
held up traffic.  The R.F.A. draft approached
at a steady double.
</p>

<p>
"Where's the fire?" yelled some.
</p>

<p>
"The Germans have captured the 'Hampshire
Arms,'" said others.
</p>

<p>
"It's for a cinema show," screamed a
ragged urchin.  Everyone gave us kindly
encouragement, and girls waved merrily as we
flew past.  The bombardier, who was on the
pavement side, threw an arm gallantly round
the waist of a stout matron of some forty
summers and dragged her, not unwillingly, half
a dozen yards before he could get home with
a kiss on the cheek.
</p>

<p>
But we caught that train with five minutes
to spare.  The men were now beginning to see
the joke.  As yet it had escaped me.  Of
course it was not the first time I had seen
"Tommy" at his cheeriest under misadventures;
but this cheeriness now struck me vividly
for the first time.  To-day it is world-famous.
</p>

<p>
They certainly made that journey a lively
one.  Six hours in a slow train across
country&mdash;it is apt to become somewhat tedious.  I
tried to look like the man who owns a dog
which persists in nibbling the trousers of total
strangers&mdash;to pretend they (the men, not the
trousers) didn't belong to me.  It was no
good.  They might have been Lancashire lads
off to Blackpool for the "wakes."
</p>

<p>
So with imitations of Harry Tate, George
Robey and other well-known favourites of the
music-halls, the railway officials at the various
stations being made the butt of the jokes; with
a weird medley of harmony and melody, from
"Hallo, hallo, who's your lady friend?" to
"Sun of my Soul," the journey passed happily
enough until the first of the Bristol stations
was reached about 11.45 P.M.
</p>

<p>
As no one knew where the A.S.C. barracks
were I got through on the telephone to H.Q.
</p>

<p>
"This is Captain Estcourt, R.F.A., speaking.
I've got&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The orderly evidently went to fetch someone
else.  It turned out to be an adjutant, who
listened to me most politely.
</p>

<p>
"No, we've got no A.S.C. here.  I don't
think there are any in Bristol.  But you might
ring up &mdash;&mdash; Barracks and see."  Prrr.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!  Is that &mdash;&mdash; Barracks?  I'm Captain&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The orderly went to fetch someone.  This
time, after a long wait, it was evidently an
irascible senior officer.
</p>

<p>
"No.  No A.S.C. here.  Try Avonmouth."  Prrr.
</p>

<p>
This looked like bedding down in the station
waiting-rooms.  Still we would try Avonmouth.
</p>

<p>
Avonmouth Headquarters received me over
the telephone most politely, considering the
time of night.
</p>

<p>
"No, we've got no A.S.C. here; but you
might ring up the Embarkation Office."  Prrr.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!  Embarkation Office?  I'm &mdash;&mdash;, etc."
</p>

<p>
The Embarkation Office was not quite so
polite in its reception.  It sounded very worried.
</p>

<p>
"No.  We've got no A.S.C. here.  You
can come along down if you like in case the
company should turn up."
</p>

<p>
Luckily the last train had not gone.  When
it drew up in the station the men greeted it as
a long-lost friend.  To the strains of "All
aboard for Dixie" they clambered in, more
cheery than ever.
</p>

<p>
At Avonmouth we came out into a wilderness
of mighty sheds.  The night breeze from
the Bristol Channel carried with it the pungent,
cleanly smell of tarred rope.
</p>

<p>
"This is Avonmouth," said I to the senior
sergeant, "and we can't go any farther unless a
ship is waiting for us.  I'm going to see where
we can bed down."
</p>

<p>
The Embarkation Office had had time to
recover from its worries and received me very
politely.
</p>

<p>
Eventually we got the men into one of
the sheds where hundreds of sacks of oats
lay about.  In ten minutes they had made
themselves amazingly comfortable and peace
reigned.
</p>

<p>
But I'm glad we went to Avonmouth.  It
gave me my first real glimpse of the astonishing
organisation under which the Expeditionary
Force was to take the field; and also of the
methods of supply.
</p>

<p>
Outside the dock gates, by all the approach
roads into the little town, there were streaming
in hundreds upon hundreds of great motor
lorries, the majority of them built to carry three
tons.
</p>

<p>
From all parts of England and Scotland
dozens were arriving every hour.  The organisation
of it!  Here was the third or fourth day
from mobilisation and there were a couple of
thousand ready for transportation.
</p>

<p>
You picture a vividly green lorry of a big
whisky distillery up North axle to axle with
the scarlet of a Brixton firm with its blatant
advertisement of somebody's corsets.  The
cockney driver from a London furnishing house
exchanged honeyed words with a colleague from
"'twixt Trent and Tweed" in a polite inquiry
as to why the hell he couldn't let his tail-board
down without using his (the Londoner's)
radiator to scrape his boots on.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you imagine Tommy's comments
when he finds a 'Johnny Walker' van bringing
up his ammunition in the wilds of Belgium,"
was the general remark, "but I suppose they'll
give them a coat of paint first."
</p>

<p>
They didn't, as a matter of fact; at least
not for several months, so that Tommy was
able to indulge his gift of language to the
full.
</p>

<p>
And so nearly two days passed.  The men
amused themselves by wandering about the
docks, wondering at the shipping, and making
sarcastic remarks about the lorry drivers who
were being taught how to handle a rifle.
</p>

<p>
Then came a telegram from H.Q., Aldershot.
</p>

<p>
"Return and report here immediately."
</p>

<p>
"Good," said the senior sergeant to me,
"I always did like Aldershot.  But we've had
quite a pleasant holiday seeing the country."
</p>

<p>
The draft duly paraded again, and when
they learned their next destination their remarks
were a joy to listen to.
</p>

<p>
We caught a 9.0 train in the evening into
Bristol.  Then we marched across the city, a
matter of, say, three miles.  It was a Sunday
night, the good citizens were abed.  But my
lads were determined to show that they were
by no means downhearted.
</p>

<p>
The march across was one long pageant of
melody.  "I'm going home to Dixie" was
prime favourite, and splendidly they sang it in
harmony.  Then some evening hymns, then
more rag-time&mdash;they were really excellent
exponents of that difficult art&mdash;then "Onward,
Christian Soldiers"; but never a note of
"Tipperary."  That immortal chorus had not
yet "arrived."
</p>

<p>
The midnight train from Bristol to Reading.
A wait of three hours.  Finally, Aldershot (the
wrong station) at 6.30 A.M.  A march of four
miles into camp somewhat took the spirit out
of the men, breakfastless and carrying heavy
kits.  But we rallied them at the last post and
came in singing "Somewhere the sun is
shining," like a choir of Welsh colliers.  We
certainly looked the part.
</p>

<p>
"We've been looking for you for a week;
where on earth have you been?" was hurled at
us as we marched in.
</p>

<p>
The bombardier started upon a story which
would have made that intrepid explorer
Captain de Rougemont green with envy.  I left
him to his astonished audience and went off for
a bath and shave before attending my own
funeral at H.Q.
</p>

<p>
It will have been observed that there were
varying degrees in the politeness with which
successive H.Q.s greeted my touring company.
The politeness with which Aldershot
Headquarters now greeted me was well below
freezing-point.
</p>

<p>
"I received your telegrams from
Portsmouth and various other places," was the
Chief's opening.  "You appear to have been
taking your men upon an extended holiday
round the southern coast health resorts.  May I
inquire, without appearing too inquisitive, your
authority for this expenditure of public money?"
</p>

<p>
"Will you allow me to explain, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"I am waiting for your explanation."
</p>

<p>
I began.  When I had recounted the story
of the A.S.C. major's arithmetical problem I
saw that I had the Great Man's attention.  As
soon as I had caught the 5 P.M. train from
Portsmouth&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, won't you," said the Great
Man; "cigarette?"
</p>

<p>
I took one from his proffered case and lit it
carefully.
</p>

<p>
"If only I can hold him," thought I, "I
shall pull through."
</p>

<p>
I did hold him, and I did pull through.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know that I can compliment you
on your perspicacity," said the Great Man,
"but I can see now where the blame lies.  I
had intended to withdraw your name from the
Expeditionary Force, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I got up, mouth open.
</p>

<p>
"Expeditionary Force?"  It can only have
been a feeble gasp which the Great Man heard.
"Am I going out with the Force?"
</p>

<p>
The Great Man smiled and put his hand on
my shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"We'll overlook it this time.  Let's see how
well you can do your job.  And if you send in
your claim for travelling expenses, send it to
me and I'll countersign it."
</p>

<p>
I suppose I must have said something by
way of thanks.  I suppose I must have saluted,
and closed the door behind me.  I know that
I cleared half a dozen or so of the stairs down
at a bound and fell over an astonished sentry at
the bottom.  It must have looked most
undignified in a Gunner captain, but&mdash;I had
actually been selected to join the British
Expeditionary Force with a command of my
own and&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
I leaped into the waiting taxicab in a state
of delirium.
</p>

<p>
The driver touched his cap.
</p>

<p>
"Where to, sir?" said he.
</p>

<p>
"Where to?  Where to?  Oh!  Brussels;
anywhere."
</p>

<p>
The driver grinned in sympathetic understanding
and got on to third speed in as many
seconds.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And that is how I very nearly missed the
most gorgeous adventure of my life.

THE SAILING OF THE FORCE

<p>
"<i>I consider that I have command of the sea when I am
able to tell my Government that they can move an expedition
to any point without fear of interference from an enemy's
fleet.</i>"&mdash;SIR GEOFFREY HORNBY.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Train No. B46 had slipped unostentatiously
into its appointed siding precisely on its
scheduled time.  For a couple of hours the
men had been working like galley-slaves to get
the ammunition on board in time.  The C.O. and
two other officers with their coats off were
working as hard as the rest.  And it is no joke
heaving up and packing neatly cases of 18-pr. and
howitzer shell, especially when you are not
used to it.
</p>

<p>
Finished at last, and with half an hour to
the good.  Another four hours and they will
be on the road themselves, the first step into
the unknown.
</p>

<p>
A couple of hours' sleep, a shave and a bath,
a final look round the battery office, a last
hurried breakfast in the Mess, and a last
handshake with the colonel.
</p>

<p>
"You off?  Well, good-bye, and good luck
to you.  We shall meet over the other side, I
expect."
</p>

<p>
The battery parades.  "Battery all present,
sir," reports the sergeant-major.  The report
runs through until it reaches the C.O.  A few
minutes to ride round the teams and then:
</p>

<p>
"Column o' route from the right.  Walk&mdash;march!"
and the battery is off through the early
morning quiet of the Aldershot streets, bound
for the port of embarkation.
</p>

<p>
Thus the mounted units, or most of them.
Others by train.  A few lines will serve as
description for all these.
</p>

<p>
A Railway Transport Officer meets the C.O. on
the platform as the men march in.
</p>

<p>
"Get your men in as quickly as you can,
please; we always get off five minutes ahead of
time."
</p>

<p>
"What's our port?" asks the C.O.
</p>

<p>
"No idea.  Push on, please."
</p>

<p>
The C.O. "pushes on."
</p>

<p>
"All in," he reports to the R.T.O., and
turns for a final shake of the hand.
</p>

<p>
"Well, good-bye, and good luck" (always
that phrase); "wish I was coming with you."
</p>

<p>
The R.T.O. gives the signal and looks
wistfully for a moment after the train before he
clambers across the metals to dispatch another
dozen or so units from other sidings.
</p>

<p>
"Where are we embarking?" asks everyone.
Not a soul knows.  I don't believe the
engine-driver himself knew.  He just went gaily
forward following the points or stopping for
signals.
</p>

<p>
"Through Winchester!  Why, it must be
Southampton.  Wonder what our port will be
the other side?"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Detraining and embarkation at Southampton
were carried out under the same admirable
conditions of efficiency and speed, and with
never a single hitch.  It seems little enough to
read the sentence in cold print, but the more
one thinks about it the more wonderful appears
the organisation.  Had it been the German
War Staff directing movements the affair would
have seemed no more than an ordinary episode.
But with memories of the South African War,
and a hundred everyday incidents constantly
revealing muddling, red-tape methods, one can
find no words in which to express adequately
one's admiration for this astonishing volte-face.
One single incident, one of fifty like it, will
show to what excellent purpose the Authorities
had profited by experience, even in those early
days.
</p>

<p>
An A.S.C. motor transport unit was detailed
to embark upon a certain ship.  Nearly a day's
warning had been given to the O.C.  The
lorries were driven to the dock-side and were
just being got on board.  The Embarkation
Officer, who was standing quietly by, suddenly
informed the C.O. that his ship was not that
one but another due to sail from another dock
some distance away.
</p>

<p>
The C.O. had barely time in which to get
his lorries across, and the ship sailed the moment
all was reported clear.
</p>

<p>
An incident trivial enough, and how un-English
it seemed at the time.  But after the
secret landing of the 9th Army Corps at Suvla,
and the subsequent evacuation of Gallipoli, it
would appear that we have nothing to learn in
the art of ruse.
</p>

<p>
The weather in those early days of August
was perfect: the sea so calm that there was no
discomfort even, with the men and horses packed
on board like sardines in a tin.  If it was a night
crossing, the men bedded down in rows out on
the decks just as they had filed on board.  The
transports were of all kinds, from an Atlantic
liner to a coasting tramp.
</p>

<p>
The ship's officers did more than their best
for everybody's comfort, giving up their cabins
to the officers, sharing their meals and refusing
to accept any payment for food and drinks.  If
the skipper of a certain ship of the Royal Mail
Company, which sailed on the early morning of
August 16th from Southampton, chances to see
these lines I would tell him how gratefully his
kindness is remembered, and how the little
mascot, in the shape of a tiny teapot from the
steward's pantry, brought the best of luck
through ten months' hard service, always made
excellent tea whenever called upon, and now
occupies a place of honour in my china cabinet.
Here's wishing everything of the best to those
who carry on the fine traditions of the blue or
red ensign!
</p>

<p>
"Well, where are we bound for?" This to
the First Officer.
</p>

<p>
"Don't know a bit," he replies.  "The
skipper may know, but I'm not sure.  Anyway
he's as close as a barnacle about it."
</p>

<p>
We steamed across Channel with all lights
on.  It was another of those astonishing facts
which didn't strike one until later.  We were
off the mouth of the Seine exactly twelve hours
after sailing.  And all that time we only once
sighted anything in the shape of a convoy, and
that was a T.B.D. for about twenty minutes
a couple of miles to starboard.
</p>

<p>
At this stage it seems almost invidious to
say anything more about the work of the Grand
Fleet during that first fortnight.  And yet,
even now, the public is amazingly ignorant of
what the Navy has accomplished, or, indeed is
still accomplishing.  Ignorant, not through
indifference, but because the Authorities still
steadily refuse to take seriously in hand the
work of education in war facts and ideas.
</p>

<p>
How the Navy succeeded in sweeping the
enemy flag from the North Sea and the Channel
in a couple of days, apparently without firing
a shot, we cannot pretend to guess.  Some day
the story will be told.  But the result was the
most astonishing manifestation of the real
meaning of naval supremacy that the world has ever
seen, or is ever likely to see.  And Germany,
by her naval inaction, lost for ever her great
chance of the War, and so, in failing to
intercept or damage the British Expeditionary
Force, failed also to enter Paris and to end the
war upon her own terms within the period she
had intended.  The British Army may have
saved Paris, but the British Navy enabled it to
do so.
</p>

<p>
Entering the Seine the skipper revealed the
name of our destination, Rouen.  Another
instance of organisation and forethought on
the part of the Authorities in using small ships
so as to get right up the river and disembark
troops and stores well inland.
</p>

<p>
Again, this has become a matter of everyday
routine, but in those days each such new
manoeuvre was sufficiently remarkable for
admiring comment.
</p>

<p>
Here the pilot came on board.  A typical
old son of Normandy he was, grizzled and
weatherbeaten, clambering aboard with stiff
heavy gait.
</p>

<p>
On to the bridge he climbed: saw our lads
clustered thick as bees in the fo'c'sle and lower
deck.  Up went his cap into the air, tears
sprang to his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Vivent les Anglais!" he shouted, "vive
l'Angleterre!  A&mdash;ah" (with an instinct of
triumph), "ça va bien.  Ils arrivent."
</p>

<p>
How the lads yelled in answer.
</p>

<p>
"Cheer-o, moossoo.  Veeve France!  'Who's
your lady friend?'  'For he's a jolly good
fellow,'"&mdash;and other pertinent observations.
</p>

<p>
Then, to my astonishment, they burst into
the "Marseillaise."  How and where they had
learned it I have no idea.  But sing it they
did, and very well too.  They took that little
curly bit in the middle, where a B flat comes
when you least expect it, just like an old hunter
clearing a stiff post-and-rails.  And that old
chap stood on the bridge and mopped his eyes,
and didn't care who saw him do it.  The English
had really come to stand by his beloved France.
<i>Comme ça va bien!</i>
</p>

<p>
That was the first hint we had of the reception
which awaited us.
</p>

<p>
You picture the transport steaming slowly
up river between the high, wooded banks.
Little houses, such as Peter Pan might have
built for Wendy, seem to sway dizzily in the
tree-tops.  Out on to the verandas, down to
the river path run the women and children,
and the few old men who remain.  Everyone
carries a little flag; not the French tricolour,
but the British Jack&mdash;or rather an excellent
substitute.
</p>

<p>
Dimly one can see the waving hands, faintly
across the water echo the treble voices.  But
know now what it means, and gallantly
our lads respond to this welcome of out
future hosts, who, with true French courtesy,
have met their guests at the very entrance
gates.
</p>

<p>
Far up the hill-side, close under the ridge,
there nestles a tiny cottage.  A blot of deep
crimson staining the deeper green of the trees
makes me take out my binoculars.  The good
house-wife, with no British flag available, yet
determined to do honour to her country's allies,
has taken the red tablecloth, has stitched long
bands of white across it to form a St. Andrew's
Cross, and flung it proudly across the balustrade.
What monarch ever had truer-hearted
welcome from his own people?  Well, the sight
brought a lump to the throat of at least one
Englishman.
</p>

<p>
And so slowly we steamed up the historic
river.  France had indeed flung wide her gates
in welcome.  Here we found ourselves moving
in a small procession of transports.  Greetings
swung across from one ship to the next, to
combine and roar out a British answer to our
French friends on shore.
</p>

<p>
Ah! but it was good to feel that Britain had
not failed France, though the obligation were
no more than a moral one.  It was good to be
an Englishman that day; good to feel that
Englishmen then in France could now look
Frenchmen squarely in the face and say:
</p>

<p>
"You thought we were going to stand aside,
didn't you?  Well, you see we are coming in
with you and you can bet that means that we
intend to see it through."
</p>

<p>
Yes, one felt proud as never before.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap03"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br />
THE LANDING OF THE FORCE
</h3>

<p>
"<i>Shall not thou and I, between Saint Dennis and Saint
George, compound a boy, half French, half English, that
shall go to Constantinople, and take the Turk by the beard?</i>"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The dominant note in the reception which the
French gave to the Force on landing was
undoubtedly that of <i>relief</i>.  Happy in showering
little courtesies, surprised and delighted
with everything British&mdash;all these, but it was
relief which came uppermost in their minds.
The feeling which the old pilot had expressed
in his "comme ça va bien, maintenant."
</p>

<p>
And as transport after transport slid quietly
to her berth alongside the broad Rouen quays,
discharged her freight of men, horses, guns,
stores, lorries, and the countless trappings of a
modern army, and then as quickly and noiselessly
vacated the berth for her successor, so
increased the wonder and delight of the good
Normandy folk.
</p>

<p>
That <i>les anglais</i> should really have arrived
was splendid enough, but that they should also
bring with them their own food and cooking
arrangements&mdash;"mais c'est tonnant! et quelle
organisation!"
</p>

<p>
Everyone spoke in admiring comment about
it.  And how Rouen crowded down to the
quays or out to the rest camps to watch <i>les
anglais</i> cooking their dinners!  Army stores
those few days were sadly depleted of tins of
jam, biscuits and "grocery ration."  How
could one refuse the hungry look in the eye of
a motherly matron as she espied a packet of
the famous English tea?
</p>

<p>
And the children!  We learned for the first
time how hungry children could be when they
saw biscuits and jam.
</p>

<p>
Make a fuss of the kiddies and you have
won the mothers!  And if you have won the
mothers and women of France you have
conquered "la belle France" herself.  And <i>les
anglais</i> conquered France in those few days at
the French ports.  The happiest of victories,
and one which augured well for the future.
</p>

<p>
Nothing pleased the French more than
British courtesy and gentleness to women and
children; and their kindness to and care of
their horses.  British love of personal cleanliness,
and the unfailing cheeriness of the men,
these have, of course, long since become
proverbial.  But then it was all new to France,
almost to the world, and so one records these
things as first impressions.
</p>

<p>
And the Scotties.  Everyone knows how
the lads from north of the Tweed made sad
havoc among French hearts.  Have they not
always done so since Frenchmen and Scotsmen
first clasped hands in alliance?
</p>

<p>
If a Scotsman was asked once a day whether
he wore anything under his kilt he was asked a
hundred times.  And truth compels me to add
that it was generally the ladies who put the
question.  What the answer was I never found
out.  I imagine that our lads were not sorry to
hide their blushes in the troop trains which
carried them forward to the frontier.
</p>

<p>
But all these little details have been so
admirably recorded by Philip Gibbs in his
masterly book, "The Soul of the War," that
there is really not much more to tell.  I shall
have still a little to add in the next chapter,
when it comes to trekking up country.
</p>

<p>
I had some little cause on the first day of
landing to regret the exuberance of French
hospitality.  Half my men, they were mostly
Special Reservists, suddenly disappeared into
the unknown directly they set foot on shore.
And they hadn't a week's pay in their pockets
either.
</p>

<p>
Eventually I got them rounded up and
next morning there were twenty-five prisoners,
"caps off," for "office."  To say they were
surprised is to give a very poor indication of
their feelings when they found varying degrees
of punishment awarded to them.
</p>

<p>
But this was nothing to the ludicrous
expressions of the men when all the remainder were
paraded and informed what they had to expect
on active service.  It ran somewhat as follows:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "When a sentry, sleeping upon his post."<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Punishment&mdash;DEATH.<br />
  "Leaving his C.O. to go in search of<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plunder."  Punishment&mdash;DEATH.<br />
  "Forcing a safeguard."&mdash;DEATH.<br />
  "Quitting his guard without leave."&mdash;DEATH.<br />
  "Disobeying the lawful command of his<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;superior officer."&mdash;DEATH.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And so on, the lightest punishment being about
fourteen years' Rigorous Imprisonment.
</p>

<p>
Their faces got longer and longer as the list
proceeded, and it was a very meek detachment
who turned to their dinners on the quay-side.
And that was the beginning and end of any
trouble with those good lads until the day when
they, or the poor remnant who pulled through,
crowded round to sing "Auld lang syne" and
give me a farewell cheer.  Fine work they did,
and always as cheery and lovable as any unit
in the Force.
</p>

<p>
Disembarkation was carried on with the
same admirable efficiency which had characterised
embarkation.  A large number of British
Staff officers had, I believe, crossed to France
immediately upon mobilisation.  There, in
collaboration with French colleagues, every possible
arrangement was made for the reception of the
Force.
</p>

<p>
Rest camps were pitched or billets were
allotted, branches of the Army Post Office were
established, a field cashier was installed at the
Banque de France and imprests in French notes
for the men's pay could be obtained on demand.
</p>

<p>
Of course everybody had seized the few
hours' holiday on board ship to write more or
less lengthy letters home, hoping, in their
innocence, that the ship's officers would post
them on returning to England.
</p>

<p>
Alas! before ever the ship was berthed, an
all-powerful bogy swarmed up the companion
way and greedily snatched away the ship's
correspondence.  Calling for a brush and a
barrel of black fluid, he gleefully set to work
upon the letters and postcards.  When he had
finished with them (and it took him a good
couple of hours on our ship) they looked like
the slips of paper you use in the parlour round-game
where the first player writes a line and
leaves the next to continue the sentence.
</p>

<p>
We had all given the most vivid description
of our adventures, filling page after page.
When the precious documents ultimately
reached their destination, our fond parents, or
best girls, must have been gratified to find that
their four-page letter had dwindled down to:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
"MY DEAR FATHER,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="t3">
(Four pages of brush and fluid work.)
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"Well, I think I have told you all the news
now.  My love to the Mater and, cheer-oh, we
shall soon be home again.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"Your affect. son,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was very interesting to compare the way
in which French and British temperaments
expressed themselves; intensely interesting to
note how each so quickly became the
complement of the other.
</p>

<p>
One knew so well the attitude of disdain of
anything foreign which invariably characterises
the Briton abroad; an unfortunate attitude
which has been encouraged, or so it would
almost seem, by the invariable courtesy, under
the most irritating conditions, of men and
women of the Latin races.
</p>

<p>
Here were some seventy or eighty thousand
men thrust headlong into a strange country.
Probably at least two-thirds of that number
had never been out of England before.  Everyone
knows the impression which your average
Englishman of the middle and lower classes has
of French men and French women.  Certainly
it has not been very complimentary.  How
would our men now bear themselves?
</p>

<p>
And if our attitude to the French has for
the most part been one of cold disdain and
amusement, the French would seem to have
regarded us, as a race, with incredulity,
tempered by such a degree of irritation as their
native courtesy would permit.  This, together
with an under current of admiration.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Que j'aime la hardiesse anglaise!</i>" says
Voltaire, "<i>que j'aime les gens qui disent ce
qu'ils pensent.</i>"
</p>

<p>
During those early August days before the
Retreat there was little real opportunity to
modify racial opinions.  But if British disdain
was not yet effaced, the overwhelming reception
by the French went far to break it down.
Soon it was to be washed clean away in the
blood sacrament which united French and
English in a closer tie than that of brothers-in-arms.
</p>

<p>
French methods and customs still amused
our men, but the amusement became that
light-hearted gaiety, in tackling and surmounting
trifling difficulties in a foreign country, which
is quite irresistible.  Here the British soldier
or sailor is always at his very best, and the
anecdotes of his adventures in French villages
and towns would fill a volume.
</p>

<p>
Wiseacres who try to invent some universal
language should certainly base it upon that of
Thomas A. in a strange country.  He is equally
at home in China, Peru, the wilds of Africa or
Spain.
</p>

<p>
The fact which astonished him more than
anything else about the French language was
that all the children spoke it.  He could
understand grown-ups learning it in time; but how
the kiddies were able to talk it with such
amazing fluency, that was quite beyond him.
</p>

<p>
As for the French attitude of mind, I am
inclined to think that their incredulity,
admiration and irritation were all intensified; the
last named, however, being even less in evidence
than before.
</p>

<p>
The attitude of the French women is easier
to define.  It is literally true to remark that,
from highest to lowest in the land, there were
no half measures in their welcome.  One can
say this now because the fact has long since
been recognised and openly discussed in France.
This, however, is not the place in which to make
more than passing reference to a subject which,
apart from the purely human aspect, is more
a matter for the student of physiology or
psychology.
</p>

<p>
"Combien de coeurs vous avez ravagé dans
un si petit délai que vous avez stationné ici,"
a French girl once remarked, "et cependant on
ne devrait pas refuser aux anglais les baisers
qu'ils nous demandent puisqu'ils se donnent
pour nous."
</p>

<p>
And the last half of the sentence admirably
sums up the French woman's point of view.
</p>

<p>
This landing of the portion of the Force
at Rouen was typical of what happened at
Boulogne or Havre.  John Buchan, in his first
volume of the "History of the War," has given
a most interesting glimpse of incidents at the
former port.
</p>

<p>
In no case did the troops remain at these
bases for more than a couple of days.  Nobody
appeared to have the least idea of what was
going on up at the frontiers, but time was
obviously of importance.
</p>

<p>
No one knew where they were bound for;
no one appeared to have the slightest presentiment
of the tragedy, and the magnificence of
the days which were so soon to crowd upon
them.  Still the cheery, light-hearted,
end-of-term spirit.  A summer holiday on the
Continong!  Cheer-oh!
</p>

<p>
And so they were merry parties of men
which boarded the funny French trains; where
you had to clamber up the sides of the carriages
from platforms which didn't really exist, and
where you were packed in like a Cup Tie crowd
returning from the Crystal Palace.
</p>

<p>
How the horses hated those French trucks.
Never before had they suffered such indignity.
I would not have been a stableman on duty in
one of those trucks for many a month's pay.
</p>

<p>
"Mais, quelles bêtes!" said the railway
officials.  And the porters would run and fetch
the stationmaster and gesticulate at the
Compagnie's trucks, which had begun to look like
bundles of firewood long before the frontier
was reached.
</p>

<p>
"Third return Clapham Junction, please,"
said the company wag.
</p>

<p>
"Wotto!  Berlin!  Not 'arf," shouted the
rest....
</p>

<p>
And off the trains would steam, every
compartment labelled "Berlin."  It's rather
pathetic how history repeats itself.  This time
the French were silent.  They <i>knew</i>.
</p>

<p>
So, forward into the unknown!

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Patience, still a little patience!  The stage is
not yet set.  The actors have not yet reached
the theatre.  Very soon now shall you see
unfolded the opening scenes of the Great
Drama, and hear the first clash of the armies.
Soon shall you have your fill of the horror and
splendour of modern warfare.
</p>

<p>
We have seen the Force into the French
troop trains, horse, guns and foot.  But not all
journeyed thus to the frontier.  Some of the
units, the most mobile, went by road.  Units
which were intended to take their places in the
reserve lines, and especially the A.S.C. motor
transport, ammunition or supplies.  Let us
move forward with one of these and see a little
of the France through which so soon the armies
will come rolling back.
</p>

<p>
Out from Rouen and across the lovely
Normandy country.  You picture the excitement
and amusement of the country folk as a
great procession of those motor lorries, which
we have seen coming into Avonmouth, pants
heavily through the towns and villages.
</p>

<p>
Here is a part of a letter, from an officer in
one of those units, which appeared in the <i>Times</i>
towards the end of August.  It seems to give a
very happy picture of the French reception of
our men.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
ROSES, ROSES, ALL THE WAY
</p>

<p>
I can, of course, tell you nothing of our
movements, nor where we are.  I can, however, say
something of the reception we have met with
moving across country.  It has been simply wonderful
and most affecting.  We travel entirely by motor
transport (if the censor will allow that), and it
has been flowers all the way.  One long procession
of acclamation.  By the wayside and through the
villages men, women, and children cheer us on
with the greatest enthusiasm, and everyone wants
to give us something.  Even the babies in arms have
been taught to wave their little hands.
</p>

<p>
They strip their flower gardens, and the cars
look like carnival carriages.  They pelt us with
fruit, cigarettes, chocolate, bread, anything, and
everything.  It is simply impossible to convey an
impression of it all.  One village had stretched
across the road a big banner, "Honour to the British
Army."  Always cries of "Vivent les anglais, vive
l'Angleterre," etc., and often they would make the
sign of hanging, and cutting the throat (the Kaiser),
pointing forward along the road.  This always struck
me as so curious.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday, my own car had to stop in a town
for petrol.  In a moment there must have been a
couple of hundred people round, clamouring.
Autograph albums were thrust in front of me; a perfect
delirium.  A tray of wine and biscuits appeared,
and before we started again the car had come to
look like a grocery delivery van with a florist's
window display in front.
</p>

<p>
In another town I had to stop for an hour and
took the opportunity to do some shopping.  I wanted
some motor goggles, an eye bath, some boracic,
provisions, etc.  They would not let me pay for a
single thing, and there was lunch and drinks as well.
</p>

<p>
The farther we go the more enthusiastic is the
greeting.  What it will be like at the end of the
war one cannot attempt to guess.
</p>

<p>
This all sounds like a picnic, but the work is
hard and continuous.  One eats and sleeps just when
one can.  There is no division between night and
day.  But we are all very fit and well, and the men,
who have an easy time compared to the officers,
look upon it as a huge joke&mdash;at present.
</p>

<p>
My French is, of course, simply invaluable, and
each day I can understand and talk better and
better.  It is extraordinary that I am absolutely
the only officer I have come across (except one or
two Staff men) who can speak it with any fluency.
Well, this will surely be the last of war amongst
civilised peoples, and the dreams of the idealists
will be fulfilled.  The French seem to think that it
will all be over certainly by Christmas.  I wonder?
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Thus the men came to see something of
French life away from the beaten track of the
tourist, and, needless to say, they made friends
at every stopping-place.
</p>

<p>
"Mais, si polis, ces messieurs anglais,"
everyone remarks.  And how could "ces
messieurs" refuse some little trifles in return
for such hospitality?  The word "souvenir"
soon became a nightmare in their dreams.
There was a peculiar bleat in the intonation of
the word which was, after a time, positively
hateful.  But during the first few days the men
gave readily enough all sorts of little articles for
which they had no immediate use, and others
for which they had.
</p>

<p>
Before a week had elapsed very few had any
buttons left.  It was a mystery how they kept
their trousers up.  Regimental badges on caps
and shoulder-straps were much appreciated,
especially the Gunners' letters.  It did not take
long for the quick-witted French girl to discover
that R.F.A. was obviously intended to represent
the Triple Entente&mdash;Russie, France,
Angleterre.
</p>

<p>
When these units eventually rolled up at
their destination it was found that about half
the men had lost not only all their buttons and
badges but their caps as well, getting in
exchange some horrible provincial product in the
shape of a rakish tweed cap.  Bits of tape and
string held coats and trousers together.
</p>

<p>
But long ere this Thomas Atkins was fed
up with souvenir-hunters, and one recalls a
<i>Punch</i> picture which showed a weary and
wounded soldier sitting by the roadside with
what remained of his kit and arms.
</p>

<p>
"'Souvenir' is it you want?" he remarks
in reply to a little urchin who is bleating the
hateful word at him.  "Here, you can take
the &mdash;&mdash; lot."  And he pitches his rifle and kit
at the youngster's head.
</p>

<p>
The officers and men who came up by road
must have had a very cheery time in the various
towns where they were billeted.  The route lay,
I believe, by way of Amiens, and so up through
St. Quentin and Bohain to Le Cateau.
</p>

<p>
Hardly was there a hint of war in all that
lovely country-side.  What war could ever touch
those glowing cornfields, those orchards heavy
with plum and apple, the stately châteaux or
dim cloisters of mediæval church or convent?
As little can we conceive our fragrant villages
of Kent or Surrey blasted and devastated by
poisonous shells.
</p>

<p>
Very, very few men were to be seen anywhere;
only Government officials and others
over military age.  Such guards or sentries as
were posted were somewhat decrepit-looking
Territorials, with arms and accoutrements which
looked as if they had done good service in 1870.
But they made up for their deficiencies in other
respects by an excess of zeal in carrying out
imaginary orders.
</p>

<p>
Their method of challenging, in particular,
had the merit of simplicity and, at the same
time, involved no undue straining of the vocal
powers.  It was merely the thrusting of a
rifle-barrel into the face or chest of the passer-by.
And when there is a very shaky hand on the
trigger you don't lose much time in getting out
your credentials.
</p>

<p>
One of these men caused much excitement
one evening by holding up and clapping into
the guardroom every single individual who
attempted to pass him.  He was performing
sentry duty across a certain main road.
</p>

<p>
This went on for a couple of hours, and
the guardroom was becoming uncomfortably
crowded with a very miscellaneous assortment
of travellers.  In fact, when a particularly
plump matron, carrying a basket of particularly
evil-smelling cheeses, was incontinently thrust
in, to fall heavily across the toes of an already
irate railway porter, there was very nearly a riot.
</p>

<p>
At length a gilded Staff officer came along.
He too was held up.  But this time the sentry
met his match.  The officer demanded to see
the N.C.O. of the guard.  Whereupon the
sentry, who was really somewhat the worse for
drink, fell down upon his knees in the road,
and with salty tears coursing down his cheeks
piteously besought the officer to allow him to
go home and get his supper.
</p>

<p>
But French Territorials did their "bit"
gallantly enough a few days later, away on the
British left.  Old reservists as they were, they
hung on splendidly at Tournai, and, led by
de Villaret, fought gallantly against overwhelming
numbers until they were surrounded, killed,
or captured.
</p>

<p>
So, on through the golden August sunshine
or beneath the heavy harvest moon.  Interminable
processions of columns, horsed and petrol-driven,
threading their way along the endless,
poplar-lined roads of France; the white dust
churned up and drifting over men and vehicles
until they look like Arctic adventurers.
</p>

<p>
No one knows what is happening in the
great "beyond."  No one very much cares.
"Let's get on and have it over," is the
philosophy of the hour.  "Expect those
Germans are being held up a bit in Belgium;
wonder where we shall come in?"
</p>

<p>
The enemy had marched in triumph through
Brussels on August 20th.  The British Force
was not actually in position until two days
later: and Brussels is only 30 odd miles from
Mons.
</p>

<p>
After it was all over; after the tide of war
had crashed forward almost to the gates of Paris
and then rolled sullenly back, one saw a little
of the devastation it had left behind.  Here are
two pictures.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
<i>August</i> 20<i>th</i>.  Can you, too, see that little
vicarage hard by the tiny church?  (Think, it
might have been plucked from a Surrey
hamlet.)  The cool, veranda-shaded rooms filled with
a hundred homely treasures; the tiled kitchen
with its winking copper pots and pans.  Out
through the flagged yard, where pigeons coo in
gentle defiance of predatory sparrows, and down
to a miniature farmstead.  The pretty alleyed
garden of roses, hollyhocks and the flowers and
sweet herbs of English garden-lovers.
</p>

<p>
Can you see the old curé as he browses over
a volume of Renan?  He has tended his flock
in that village for a quarter of a century.  A
pretty niece keeps house for him; and her dainty
herb-potions and unwearied nursing have saved
many a life in the little community.  They think
of her as of an angel from heaven.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<i>September</i> 7<i>th</i>.  A fortnight later!  The
village street has disappeared beneath the debris
of what was once the village.  One cow-shed is
still miraculously intact, and from it creeps a
gaunt, haggard old crone.  They have not
touched her.  She was too old and infirm to
make good fun, even for the rank and file.
</p>

<p>
She points with shaking finger to the wayside
crucifix from which the Christ looks down
with infinite patience.  He also has been
miraculously preserved.  He gazes still over His
tiny sanctuary, now but two blackened, battered
walls.  The vicarage has disappeared as though
in an earthquake.  The incendiary tablets have
done their work well.  The little garden with
its pretty rose trees has been ploughed up, it
would seem, by giant shares.
</p>

<p>
Stay, in one corner, down by the brook,
there is planted a rough wooden cross.
</p>

<p>
The old curé had refused to leave his post
when the stream of refugees had passed through.
They told him of the horror behind them.  He
stood firm.  Jeannette, too, would stay with her
uncle.
</p>

<p>
<i>They</i> came.  The curé, they said, must be
a spy left behind by the French troops.  Besides,
he had carrier-pigeons.  "What need have we
of further witnesses?"
</p>

<p>
And so they tied him against the stem of
his pigeon-cote.  He met his death as a gallant
gentleman of France.
</p>

<p>
The girl.  Ah, young and tender!  Good
sport for the plucking!  First let her bury the
old man.  "Rather hard work using a spade
when you're not used to it, isn't it?&mdash;Done?
Good, now get us dinner."
</p>

<p>
After dinner, a dance&mdash;Eastern slave
fashion.  First, good sport for the officers.
"When we have finished throw her to the men."
</p>

<p>
What need to tell the horrors of it?  The
village marked the ebb of the tide.  The French
and British had turned at last.  Hurried orders
came to retire at dawn.  The girl had not been
such good sport after all&mdash;fainted too easily.
</p>

<p>
A leering, drunken satyr slashes at her naked
breasts with his bayonet and Jeannette falls
dead over the threshold.  The house is fired, the
body is pitched on to the pyre.
</p>

<p>
One village in France?  No, one of a
hundred where such things were done.  And this
is almost as nothing beside such as this England
of ours has, by God's gracious mercy, been
spared.  What does England know of this war?
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
Now the various units begin to converge and
concentrate on the French frontier.  "Each
unit," says the G.O.C.-in-Chief in his first
dispatch, "arrived at its destination in this
country well within the scheduled time."
</p>

<p>
For some days past the French troop trains
have been disgorging their living freight at a
number of stations and sidings, most of them
hastily improvised, within a few miles' radius on
a line Valenciennes-Maubeuge.
</p>

<p>
The columns which came by road halted in
various little villages about the town of Le
Cateau.  You will get the general lie of the
land and the principal points of interest from
the picture-map.
</p>

<p>
Now to set the stage.

CHAPTER V
</h3>

<h3>
THE MARSHALLING OF THE ARMIES
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Now entertain conjecture of a time,<br />
  When creeping murmur, and the poring dark,<br />
  Fills the wide vessel of the universe.<br />
  From camp to camp, through the foul womb of night,<br />
  The hum of either army stilly sounds,</i><br />
<span style="letter-spacing: 4em">*****</span><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>..... and from the tents,<br />
  The armourers, accomplishing the knights,<br />
  With busy hammers closing rivets up,<br />
  Give dreadful note of preparation.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A well-known American, it was probably
Roosevelt, remarked à propos of the outbreak
of the War that Germany's readiness would
redound to her eternal dishonour, while Britain's
unreadiness would be to her eternal honour.
</p>

<p>
The term "unready" applies to the nation
as a whole.  Fortunately for civilisation the
British Navy and the little striking Force were,
as we have seen, kept trained to an hour.  And
so it was that, upon a single word, the whole
machine moved precisely as the admirable
organisation had planned for it.
</p>

<p>
It must also be remembered that for some
years past everybody who had studied
international affairs with any intelligence knew
precisely how and where Germany would attack;
that even in 1908 it was possible to give the
approximate date of such attack; and that when
the attack came the position of the British
Expeditionary Force would be in the post of
honour upon the left of the French line in,
approximately, the district in which it actually
deployed.
</p>

<p>
Thus, up to a certain point, events fell out
as anticipated.  But one or two big factors were
not foreseen, or, at least, not sufficiently
appreciated.  These were the amazing speed and
mobility with which the German initial attack
was destined to develop; the overwhelming
numbers of the enemy; and, lastly, the astonishing
effect of big gun fire, as instanced at Liége
and other fortresses.  This lack of foresight
came within an ace of losing the war for the
Entente Powers.
</p>

<p>
It was not until Saturday, August 15th,
that the gates into Belgium by way of Liége
were fully opened for the German armies,
although Liége itself had been entered on the 7th.
</p>

<p>
The immediate effect, apart from the great
moral value, of Belgium's heroic and successful
resistance of those two or three days was to give
to the British Force at least a sporting chance.
The Force was late; those three days allowed
it to get into position.  It needs no great effort
to imagine what would otherwise inevitably
have happened.
</p>

<p>
Now let me at this point disclaim any intention
of giving details of strategy and tactics,
even were I sufficiently competent to do so.
So far as I can I shall try to tell the story as
simply as possible, omitting everything which
may tend to confusion or which may render
necessary continuous reference to maps.  In a
word, I am making this record of facts and
impressions for the public, not for the experts.
It is the human side and not the military which
I would emphasise.
</p>

<p>
It is, however, necessary at the outset to
get a good general idea of numbers, and the
disposition of the armies on August 22nd in the
particular area, if we wish fully to appreciate
the events, and their significance, of the
succeeding ten days.  For the sake of convenience I
will make sub-headings:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>The German Forces</i>
</p>

<p>
The total strength, all ranks, of a German
<i>Army Corps</i> is, roughly, 45,000; of a <i>Division</i>,
roughly, 17,500.  We may take this as a
minimum.
</p>

<p>
Each Corps and each Division has, respectively,
about 160 and 72 field-guns, and 48 and
24 machine-guns.  The numbers of the latter
arm were materially increased during 1913-14.
</p>

<p>
The German forces which concentrated on
this far Western front, from Namur to about
Tournai, consisted of no fewer than 13 Army
Corps, <i>each Corps being augmented by an extra
Division</i>.  These Reserve Divisions were, I
believe, combined into separate "Reserve
Corps."
</p>

<p>
The Corps were divided up:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  5 under von Kluck (First German Army),<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attacking British.<br />
  4 under von Buelow (Second German<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Army), attacking 5th French Army.<br />
  4 under von Hausen (Third German<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Army), attacking 4th French Army.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The general lines of advance will be seen in
plan A (page 71) and plan B (page 98).
</p>

<p>
Thus, the total German force concentrated
on or about this immediate front must have
numbered at least 812,500, with, say, 3,010
field-guns and 936 machine-guns.
</p>

<p>
It is not unreasonable to add to this total
the not inconsiderable number of cavalry which
operated, more or less independently, on the
extreme flanks, and particularly from Tournai
down through Amiens towards Le Havre.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>The French Forces</i>
</p>

<p>
The total strength, all ranks, of a French
Army Corps is, roughly, 40,000, with, say,
160 field- and 48 machine-guns.
</p>

<p>
In this area there were present 3 corps under
Lanrezac (5th French Army) holding the line
Charleroi-Namur, and 3 corps under de Langle
de Gary (4th French Army) holding a line west
of the River Meuse south-west from Namur.
</p>

<p>
Away on the left flank of the British was
another Corps, of Territorials, under d'Amade;
and near Maubeuge, in reserve, were two or
three Cavalry Divisions.  These last did not, I
believe, operate; and the Territorials were also
fully occupied in their own area.
</p>

<p>
Reckoning up, then, we get an approximate
total of, say, 240,000 men, 960 field- and 288
machine-guns.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>The British Forces</i>
</p>

<p>
A British Army Corps, of two Divisions,
contains about 36,145, all ranks, with 152
field- and 48 machine-guns.
</p>

<p>
A Cavalry Division contains about 9,270,
all ranks, with 24 field- and 24 machine-guns; a
Cavalry Brigade about 2,285, all ranks, 6
field- and 6 machine-guns.
</p>

<p>
This is not revealing State secrets, because
the numbers may be obtained from any military
reference books.
</p>

<p>
Now it was, I believe, originally intended
that the Expeditionary Force should be about
120,000 strong, or half the strength of the army
with the colours.
</p>

<p>
The force actually present at Mons on
August 22nd consisted, nominally, of two
Army Corps, a Cavalry Division and a Cavalry
Brigade.  But several authorities, including
Mr. Hilaire Belloc, assert that one of these
corps was considerably below strength, and
that, in round numbers, the strength of the
Force was no more than 75,000, with 250 guns.
</p>

<p>
If we calculate up the <i>official</i> strength the
numbers should work out at 83,845 all ranks,
334 field- and 126 machine-guns.
</p>

<p>
Another Infantry Brigade came up on the
23rd and joined the Second Corps, and another
Division (the 4th) also arrived.[<a id="chap05fn1text"></a><a href="#chap05fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
Taking everything into account it is, I think,
reasonable to put the British strength at about
80,000 men, 300 field- and 100 machine-guns
when battle was first joined.
</p>

<p>
Let me put these figures in tabular form
so that we can get a comparison at a glance.
</p>

<pre>
                                                <i>Machine-</i>
                  <i>All ranks.    Field-guns.      guns.</i>

  <i>Actual Approximate Numbers on August</i> 22<i>nd</i>

  <i>British</i> . . .    80,000          300           100
  <i>French</i>  . . .   240,000          960           288
  <i>German</i>  . . .   812,500        3,016           936

  <i>Excess German
  strength over
  Franco-British</i>  492,500        1,756            548
</pre>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It is always rather difficult to grasp the
<i>meaning</i> of big numbers like these, so let me
put it another way.
</p>

<p>
Place one German against each man in the
Franco-British Force, and one German field-gun
against each field-gun on our side.  Now take
all the German soldiers and guns still
remaining over and imagine that you are watching
them march past you down Whitehall, the
men in fours all doing their "goose" parade
step and the guns going by at a trot.
</p>

<p>
The army, marching night and day, without
a moment's halt, would take just about three
days to pass you.
</p>

<p>
Such then was the enemy superiority; about
four or five times as great as the most pessimistic
prophets had anticipated.  We shall see
shortly what this superiority developed into
against the British Force.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>The Position of the Forces</i>
</p>

<p>
British.&mdash;The general position of the opposing
forces before battle was joined, at least for
the British, will be realised from plan A
(page 71), and there is little need to add
anything by way of explanation.
</p>

<p>
It will be noted that the British line extended
along a front of about 25 miles, with Mons near
the centre of the line.  On Saturday, August
22nd, Sir John French disposed the Force into
its positions.  The Second Corps, under Sir
Horace Smith-Dorrien, held the canal line from
Condé, on the west, to Mons, on the east.  The
First Corps, under Sir Douglas Haig, extended
from Mons, on the west, to Binche, on the east.
</p>

<p>
As there were no British reserves, the
Cavalry Division, under General Allenby, was
detailed to act as such and to be ready to move
forward where and as required.
</p>

<p>
The 5th Cavalry Brigade, under Sir Philip
Chetwode, was posted in and around Binche.
</p>

<p>
French.&mdash;I have indicated the composition
of the French force, and plan A (page 71) will
show how it was disposed on the morning of
the 22nd; i.e. 5th French Army from Charleroi
to just south of Namur, and 4th Army down
the River Meuse to south of Dinant.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, there is nothing further to add
about the German dispositions if the general
lines of the enemy advance be noted: an
attempted out-flanking movement on the
extreme west, and the driving in of a wedge in
the neighbourhood of Namur.  These, together
with heavy frontal attacks.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In all that follows it is necessary to add in,
by way of reinforcements on the German side,
the very great moral encouragement which the
enemy had received by their triumphal passage
through Belgium.  They were in overwhelming
strength; their heavy guns had crushed the
fortresses in a few hours like so many egg-shells;
they had, for many a long year, believed
themselves invincible as against the world; and now
they were marching directly upon Paris with
the confident hope that within three months
France would have ceased to exist as a nation,
and that by the end of the year the war would
be finished, with terms of peace dictated by
their all-highest and supremely-powerful deity,
the Kaiser.
</p>

<p>
It was, too, not merely an army disciplined
and trained in the minutest details of war which
was thus bludgeoning forward into France; it
was, in effect, a nation in arms.  A nation
which, for many a long year past, had been
educated to regard war as the greatest of all
earthly things&mdash;-a supreme issue to which all the
sciences and arts of the preliminary years of
peace were to be directed.
</p>

<p>
It was a nation which regarded as fully
legitimate any means whatever to the supreme
end desired.
</p>

<p>
I recall a remark made to me during the
South African War by a Prussian naval officer.
</p>

<p>
"You English," he said, "do not know the
rudiments of war.  When the day comes for us
to go to war you shall see how we deal with
the men, women and children.  With us terror
is our greatest weapon."
</p>

<p>
To-day the world knows how that weapon
has been mercilessly wielded; and how impotent
it has been.
</p>

<p>
On her side Britain was equally united, but
in a different sense.  She had taken up the
gauntlet because her people were assured that
the cause was a just one.  In those early days
the Expeditionary Force was not concerned
one way or the other with the reasons for its
presence in France.  The men were, for the
most part, quite ignorant of the facts; they
were there as a professional army to do their
"bit," as they had often had to do it before,
and I cannot recall a single instance during the
first month where the men spoke of the meaning
of the war.
</p>

<p>
In numbers they were hopelessly insignificant
beside the enormous masses ranged
against them, but, for its size, the army with
the colours has always been recognised the world
over as without a peer.
</p>

<p>
There was, however, one factor which in no
small degree tended to level the balance.
Discipline in the Germany Army meant discipline
in the mass, by regiments or companies, under
constant supervision of officers and N.C.O.'s.
In the British Army it meant discipline of the
individual.  In a word, if a British soldier finds
himself alone in a tight corner he generally
knows how to get out, if it is humanly possible.
The German, accustomed from his childhood to
be dry-nursed in every trivial detail of his
every-day life, would be hopelessly at sea when forced
to act on his own initiative.  When properly
led the German is splendidly courageous, and
in this respect, quite apart from numbers and
moral, it was an exceedingly tough proposition
which French and British were up against at Mons.
</p>

<p>
As regards the French it is rather more
difficult to estimate their outlook in the early
days.  From their experience in 1870 they knew
what war with Germany meant, both in the
actual fighting and in the nameless atrocities
which the enemy committed on the civil
population.  Thus they wanted their revenge.
</p>

<p>
But France had not yet suffered in this
war.  She had not yet seen her borough officials
taken as hostages and murdered in cold blood;
her older men sold into slavery; her women
raped and mutilated; her infant children
impaled upon the bayonet and thrown into the
fire; her Cathedral of Rheims tortured and
desecrated.  All this was yet to come.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning they fought valiantly but
blindly.  The shock was too sudden and
overwhelming.  Mistakes were made in the higher
commands.
</p>

<p>
But within the month France awoke.  The
Soul of her still lived; and it was the Soul of
a nation which was mighty many a generation
before ever Germanic tribes had banded together
in primitive community.
</p>

<p>
The Soul of France awoke in every one of
her children.  Not one, man, woman or child,
but saw the way clear before him, but felt the
grip of steel-cold determination to follow that
path straight to the end.
</p>

<p>
Such was the France which turned at bay
before the very gates of her capital, to show
the world that the doom of civilisation's enemy
was irrevocably sealed.
</p>

[<a href="#chap05fn1text">1</a>] Until Wednesday the 26th, the 19th Brigade was acting
directly under orders from G.H.Q.  On that date, being isolated

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The dawn of Sunday, the 23rd, broke dim and
misty, giving promise of heat.  From the late
afternoon of the previous day squadrons and
reconnaissance patrols from Chetwode's Cavalry
Brigade had been pushing well forward on the
flanks and front of the British line.  They were
regiments with names "familiar in our mouths
as household words": 12th Lancers, 20th
Hussars and Scots Greys.
</p>

<p>
It was pretty though delicate work this
feeling forward to get into touch with enemy
outposts and patrols.  Nor was there a troop which
did not have some story to tell that evening of
a tussle with enemy cavalry, with its ending,
happy or otherwise, determined by the more
wide-awake patrol.
</p>

<p>
In one place an officer's patrol, moving
quietly out from a grassy forest track, stumbled
straight upon a dozen Uhlans having a meal.
The British had no time to draw swords, and
certainly the Uhlans hadn't, it was just a
question of riding them down, and swords and pistols
out when you could.
</p>

<p>
In another place a German and a British
patrol entered a village simultaneously from
either end, unbeknown to each other.  The
turn of a corner and they were face to face.
Our men were the more wide-awake, and they
got spurs to their horses and swords out before
the enemy grasped the situation.  The little
affair was over in five minutes.
</p>

<p>
But as our cavalry pushed farther and
farther northwards they found themselves
confronting ever-increasing numbers, and
retirement became necessary.
</p>

<p>
Thus were the first shots fired.
</p>

<p>
At six in the morning of this Sunday, Sir
John French held a "pow-wow" with the
three G.O.C.'s, Generals Haig, Smith-Dorrien
and Allenby, and discussed the situation,
somewhat in these terms:[<a id="chap06fn1text"></a><a href="#chap06fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
"So far as I can see from the messages I've
had from French H.Q. I don't think we've got
more than a couple of Corps in front of us,
perhaps a Cavalry Division as well.[<a id="chap06fn2text"></a><a href="#chap06fn2">2</a>]  And it
doesn't look as though they are trying to
outflank, because the cavalry have been right out
there and didn't meet with much opposition;
nor do the aircraft appear to have noticed
anything unusual going on.  It'll be a big enemy
superiority, but I don't think too big if we've
got dug in properly and the lines are all right.
We ought to hold them when they come on.
The French, as you know, are holding our
right, Namur, and down the Meuse."
</p>

<p>
Here is a plan to show the situation as it
was known at G.H.Q.:
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-071"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-071.jpg" alt="PLAN A" />
<br />
PLAN A
</p>

<p>
The morning wears on.  You picture the
country-side as not unlike one of our own
mining districts, the little villages and
low-roofed houses giving that curious smoky, grimy
effect of mean suburbs bordering on a large
industrial town.  Here and there great heaps
of slag or disused pits and quarries; gaunt
iron stems carrying great wheels and heavy
machinery.
</p>

<p>
The soldiers are billeted all through the
houses or make a shake-down in odd barns and
yards.  Look over the garden gate of one little
house and you will see the company cooks of
one regiment getting the Sunday dinner ready,
peeling the potatoes, swinging the pots on to
the camp fires.
</p>

<p>
From a barn hard by you'll hear the sound
of singing.  A padre has looked in as the rollicking
chorus of "Who's your lady friend?" swung
out into the roadway, and with gentle interruption
has improvised a short service, suggesting
"Rock of Ages" as a substitute for the music-hall ditty.
</p>

<p>
Down the road a couple of sergeants of the
West Ridings lean idly over a gate smoking and
watching the folk going off to Mass.
</p>

<p>
Out over the canal line the men are hard at
work trench-digging, pausing now and again to
look skywards as the drowsy hum of an
aeroplane propeller sounds over them.  Whether
the machine is friend or foe they have
no idea.
</p>

<p>
Three girls saunter down the road, arms
round waists, and stop to look with interest and
amusement at some of the West Kents washing
out their shirts.  One of the men is stripped
for a wash and Marie exchanges a little repartee
with him, to run off laughing as a burly
lance-corporal plants a sounding kiss on her cheek, by
way of finishing the argument.
</p>

<p>
So peaceful it all is, with just that
under-current of excitement which the presence of
strange troops would give.  Imagine a
Lancashire or Yorkshire village on a summer
Sunday morning and you have the picture.
</p>

<p>
It is now eleven o'clock and the people are
streaming home from church.  The service
seems to have been cut rather shorter than
usual and there is just a hint of anxiety to be
seen on their faces.  What was it the curé had
said, something about keeping quietly in their
homes and trusting <i>le bon Dieu</i>?  But there is
no danger, the English are here to protect us.
Still, those aeroplanes have an ugly sound,
something of <i>un air menaçant</i>.
</p>

<p>
Another aeroplane&mdash;and look, it has a great
black cross under the wings!  Un Boche?  No,
it cannot be.  Ah, see, see, a French one,
ours!  It goes to meet it.  Mon Dieu! they
fight!  And dimly from the sunny heaven there
falls the crackle of revolvers.
</p>

<p>
A motor dispatch-rider hurls himself from
his machine straight upon the astonished group
of West Kents.
</p>

<p>
"Where's the officer?  Get moving; you're
wanted up there!" and he jerks a thumb over
his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
The men rush for their kit and rifles.
Away to the west there is the crack of an
18-pounder.
</p>

<p>
Down the street the cyclist pants.  A subaltern
bursts in on the Sunday dinner of the
Bedfords.
</p>

<p>
"Fall in outside at once!"
</p>

<p>
Another aeroplane sails over.  It hovers for
a moment over the Scottish Borderers in their
trenches.  A trail of black smoke drops down,
and instinctively the men cower below the
parapet.  Slowly it falls.  Nothing more.  The
men raise their heads.
</p>

<p>
"Eh, man, but a thocht yon werre one o' thae&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
A sudden, odd hum in the air, and then&mdash;crash!
</p>

<p>
The Scots corporal slowly and painfully drags
himself out from the pile of earth and debris
and looks round.  There is a curious numb
feeling in his right arm.  He sits up with a dazed
gasp.  There is a hand by him on the ground.
His?  He looks at his arm, and realises.  Near
by five of his pals are laid out.  He seems to
have escaped.
</p>

<p>
"The Lord ha' maircy&mdash;but the regiment's
fair blooded this day," and he falls back in a
faint.
</p>

<p>
More aeroplanes, more trails of smoke; and,
wherever they fall, within twenty odd seconds a
German shell bursts fair and true.
</p>

<p>
All down the line there springs the crack of
rifles.  Beyond the canal the outposts of the
Lincolns, Royal Scots and others are coming in
at the double.  A curtain of shell-fire is lowered
behind them as the British batteries come into
action.  A curtain of fire rolls down before
them as the German guns take the range.
</p>

<p>
It is now close upon one o'clock, and enemy
shells have begun to creep nearer and nearer
in from the suburbs upon Mons itself.  The
good curé and his words are forgotten, for what
living things can remain?  And so there begins
that pitiable exodus of old men, women and
children which streamed steadily southwards,
ever increasing as it crowded through the
villages and towns.
</p>

<p>
But there is no time to-day to think of them.
They must go, or stay and perish&mdash;anything so
long as they do not interfere with the great game
of War.
</p>

<p>
North of the town, where our lines necessarily
bulged out, making a salient, the fighting
was becoming desperate.  Here three regiments
especially (the Middlesex, Royal Irish and
Royal Fusiliers) lost very heavily as they sturdily
contested every yard of ground.  This particular
point had, from the first, been recognised as
the weakest in the British lines.
</p>

<p>
Barely an hour since the first shots were
fired, and now by one o'clock practically every
gun and every rifle of the British Force is
blazing away as though the powers of hell were
set loose.
</p>

<p>
As yet it would seem that the ammunition
is being merely wasted for the sake of making
a noise.  There is no enemy in sight save in the
air the circling aeroplanes, and away on the
flanks dimly-seen clouds of horsemen.  A
modern battlefield with its curious emptiness
has so often been described that here one need
only record the fact in passing.  There is
nothing to be seen.  The men are firing, in the
first flush of excitement, at corners of possible
concealment&mdash;the line of a hedge, the edge of
a wood, the very occasional flash of a field-gun.
On the left, in the Second Corps, the British
fire slackens somewhat as the men pull themselves
together.  No one has the foggiest notion
of what is really happening.  It is the officers'
business of the moment to steady the ranks and
keep them under cover.
</p>

<p>
But away on the right, out by Binche, where
the Guards are, the storm has burst in fullest
fury.  No slackening there.  The extreme right
was held by battalions of historic regiments,
names to conjure with: Munster Fusiliers,
Black Watch, Scots and Coldstream Guards.
Ah, those Guards!  The glorious discipline of
them!  But how distinguish between any of the
regiments that day, and after?
</p>

<p>
Almost from the first the senior officers
began to realise that something was wrong,
especially on the right.  The Divisional
Commanders and their immediate staffs, to whom
the general idea of strengths and dispositions
was known, began to wonder whether a big
mistake had not been made.  "Well, never
mind, we're in for it now, we must do the best
we can.  But, those guns!  There certainly
should not be so many out there."
</p>

<p>
And it was positively uncanny how the
German guns got their range.  That fact struck
everybody almost more than anything else.
There appeared to be no preliminary ranging,
as was always usual, but guns got direct on to
the target at once.
</p>

<p>
It is difficult at times to avoid launching
out into details which are of more interest to
soldiers than to the general public, but as
everything at this time was so new an occasional
lapse may perhaps be excused.
</p>

<p>
Again, one's brain is so confused with such
a mass of detail that it becomes most difficult
to disentangle impressions and note them down
in dispassionate language.  If, however, the
reader will take the little pen-pictures of
incidents which are given and imagine them, not
as isolated facts but as being reproduced fifty
times all through the fighting lines, he may get
a fair idea of the course of events.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
As the day wore on that uncanny effect of
the German fire increased.  There is no doubt
that it was mainly due to the amazingly efficient
secret service of the enemy.  The H.Q. of a
division or a brigade, for instance, does not
blatantly advertise its position, and yet time
and time again shells were dropped clean on to
the particular building where the Staff happened
to be.  And when they got into another building,
plump would come more shells.
</p>

<p>
Looking back it is a little curious to remember
that even in that first week a very considerable
percentage of our total casualties were
caused by high explosive shell, and the shooting
of them was astonishingly accurate.
</p>

<p>
Yes, the German guns did their work well,
but they did not fully succeed in their object.
Their local successes were great, especially
against British guns and batteries.
</p>

<p>
Here is a British battery which has made
two mistakes&mdash;it is not sufficiently concealed,
the battery commander is perched up on an
observation limber, and the guns are not far
enough back behind the crest.  (The Germans
always "search" for some 300 yards behind
crests of hills.)  The B.C. is quickly spotted by
an aeroplane observer and a perfect hell of fire
is switched on by the enemy.  In a moment
telephone wires are cut, communications are
broken, and within five minutes the gun
detachments are wiped out.
</p>

<p>
The effect of a shell from the enemy heavier
guns is overwhelming.  The flank gun of the
battery is hit, practically "direct."  Some
R.A.M.C. men double up a few minutes later
to help out the wounded.  There is nothing,
save a great hole, fragments of twisted steel,
and&mdash;a few limbs of brave men.  Nothing can
be done except, later, dig in the sides of the pit
to cover the remains.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the guns remain, but there is no
one to work them.  The horses, a little way to
the rear, have also suffered badly.  A subaltern
officer staggers painfully through the tornado
of fire from one gun to the next, slowly,
deliberately putting them out of action, rendering
them useless should the enemy come up to
capture them.
</p>

<p>
Early in the afternoon Brigade Commanders
have got orders round to the British lines to
hold up the infantry fire as far as possible.  It
is now all well under control, for everyone
realises that the artillery bombardment was a
preliminary only, that the real attack is yet to
come.  The men have had their baptism of fire
and magnificently have they stood it.  This is
discipline, and now they are ready for anything
which may come along.

</p>

<p>
But already the casualties have been very
heavy.  Early in the day you have seen that
company of the West Kents double up to the
support of their battalion entrenched about
half-way along the Second Corps line.  I find a note
in my diary: "W. Kents, Middlesex and
Northumberlands" (they were all in the
Second Corps) "decimated by shell fire."  One
or two companies of the W. Kents were, I
believe, on outpost duty, which would mean
that they were literally wiped out.
</p>

<p>
And, remember, the British trenches were
not those of later days round Ypres.  They
had all been hastily dug in extremely hard and
difficult ground, so that there were none of
the niceties of snug dug-outs and bomb-proof
shelters.  In many places it was just a matter
of scratching up the soil behind a hump of
shale and cramming oneself in as far as one
could go.  To imagine, as one is led to do by
some writers, that our men sat snugly in deep
trenches through all that shell fire waiting
calmly for the infantry attack is to get a
hopelessly wrong idea.  And if this was so on the
first day when the men started in fresh, the
conditions during the days which followed may
be vaguely guessed.
</p>

<p>
Think for a moment of the splendid work
the R.A.M.C. were doing all this time.  I
wonder how many V.C.'s were earned by that
self-sacrificing corps during the week.  It is
easy enough to do what people call a gallant
deed with arms in your hands when the blood
is up, to pick up a live bomb and hurl it
away&mdash;little trifles of the moment which no one
thinks twice about,&mdash;but the courage demanded
in walking quietly into a hail of lead to bandage
and carry out a wounded man, a feat which the
R.A.M.C. men in the firing lines do a dozen
times a day, <i>that</i> is worth talking about.
</p>

<p>
On our right the fight does not go well for
us, and the suspicion that some mistake has
been made becomes a certainty.  If it is only
a matter of two German corps and a Cavalry
division in front of our position where on earth
have all those guns come from?
</p>

<p>
Still the British guns out towards Binche
go pounding gallantly on, hopelessly outmatched
though they are.  It's pretty shooting,
for our 18-prs. can get in six or seven shots a
minute more than the German field-guns, but
we cannot compete against their heavier metal.
And, just as in a naval fight, it is the heavier
metal which tells.
</p>

<p>
The fighting on the right where General
Lomax has the 1st Division has not slackened
for a moment, but steadily becomes more
intense.  Now, for the first time, the enemy is
really seen.  And as his infantry begin an
advance the German shell-fire redoubles in
intensity.  Every house where British can be
concealed, every possible observation post, every
foot of trench, every hill-crest and 400 yards
behind it is swept and devastated by the
tornado.
</p>

<p>
What communication between units is
possible in such a storm?  Now battalions and
batteries find themselves cut off from their
neighbours, each fighting and carrying on by
itself.
</p>

<p>
Chetwode's Cavalry Brigade is caught in
the thick of it.  The Guards are out there
and they hold on almost by their teeth.  The
1st Irish are in action for the first time since
their formation.  They'll see the Germans in
hell before they're going to quit.  The Munsters
are in the hottest corner, if indeed you
can see any degrees of difference.
</p>

<p>
The cavalry have to go; and the Munsters
and Black Watch lose horribly as they cover
the retirement.  No finer fighting regiments in
the world than these on the right, but nothing
human can stay there and live.  The little town
of Binche is abandoned; the first enemy success
that day.  The First Corps has had to swing
back its outer flank.
</p>

<p>
But if you think that the Black Watch, or
the Guards, or any of them, have been sitting
there quietly to be shot at when there's an
enemy in sight, you know little of those
regiments.  And you don't imagine that the Scots
Greys, or Lancers, or Hussars, with such a
reputation behind them, are going to sneak out
of Binche by a back way without first getting
a little of their own back.
</p>

<p>
No, if the Germans have got to have Binche
they must bring up a great many more men
than that to take it.  There has been much talk
of a repetition of that famous charge of the
Greys, with the Black Watch hanging on to
the stirrup-leathers.  If indeed it was repeated
that August then this must have been the
moment.  I am sorry to say that I have never
been able to obtain any real confirmation of
the story, so I shall not set it down.
</p>

<p>
But it might well have happened, and one
likes to think that it did.  Anyway, during that
hour or so, there was many a gallant, desperate
charge in that corner.  A charge against
overwhelming odds, when the utmost to be expected
was the breaking and rout of the first two or
three lines of the advance.
</p>

<p>
It needs no vivid flight of imagination to
picture it.  On the far outskirts of the town a
railway line runs.  Under the lee of a sheltering
embankment and bridge the officers collect
and re-form some of the squadrons, now grown
pitiably less in numbers.  Words of command
are almost inaudible, but the men understand.
Hard by, on their left, you have the flanking
companies of the line regiments.  One or two
brief messages pass to and fro between cavalry
and infantry.
</p>

<p>
"The Greys and Lancers are going to
charge the left of infantry advancing beyond
the wood.  Give them all the support you can!"
</p>

<p>
The British fire slackens from loophole and
broken window.  The Scottish regiment and
the Coldstream Guards insist on taking a share.
They cut out through the leaden hail and make
some yards' advance, dropping again under what
cover they can.
</p>

<p>
A last look round, a final pull at girth-straps,
and the word is passed.  The enemy
infantry is 300 yards away.
</p>

<p>
"Tr-rot!"  They are clear of the embankment.
All well in hand.  The enemy guns
have not yet got them.
</p>

<p>
The Scots and Coldstream Guards make
another rush and again drop.
</p>

<p>
"Can-ter!"  And men and horses settle
down into the steady swing.  The infantry who
have got the orders to support start blazing
away again as fast as they can get the magazine
clips home.
</p>

<p>
Now the German gunners see what is happening
and one gun after another drops its
range and fuse.  The German infantry is 250
yards away.
</p>

<p>
"Cha-arge!"  No need to sound it.  The
officers are in front, and where the officers go
their men will follow.  Anywhere!
</p>

<p>
The Scots and Coldstreamers are after them
as hard as they can leg it.
</p>

<p>
The enemy on the flank try to swing round
to meet the charge, but there is no time.  The
German guns mercilessly drop the range still
more&mdash;what matter if they sweep away their
own men as well.
</p>

<p>
One hundred yards!  Fifty yards!  A long,
sickening crash&mdash;and the Greys and Lancers are
in them.  Hacking, slashing, hewing!  The
Scots are hard on their heels just to their left.
A mighty heave as the bayonets get home.
The first rank is through.  There are no more
ranks, only a vast confusion.
</p>

<p>
Five little minutes (it seems an eternity)
and the enemy flank is crushed in, smashed to
pulp as a block of stone smashes in the head
of a man.
</p>

<p>
"Who goes home?"  Who can?  Ten
men, a dozen, perhaps twenty have struggled
through.  A few will cover again the ground
over which they charged.  A few, such a tiny
few, will get back under cover again.  "The
rest is silence."
</p>

<p>
But they have done it.  The enemy have
learned what a British charge is like.  They
know now what bayonet work is, and the lesson
sinks deep.  They will not face the steel again.
Ask the men who fought at the Aisne, at
Ypres.

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>But pardon, gentles all,<br />
  The flat unraised spirits that have dar'd,<br />
  On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It may be of interest at this point if the
narrative be broken off for a few minutes to
give some details of the methods the Germans
employ in their infantry attack, especially as
they differ so greatly from our own.
</p>

<p>
The two main features are (<i>a</i>) they consider
rifle work as of comparatively little value and
rely mainly on machine-gun fire, and (<i>b</i>) they
attack in dense masses, shoulder to shoulder.
</p>

<p>
British methods are, or were, precisely the
opposite.  Our men have brought musketry to
such perfection that an infantryman will get off
in one minute almost double the number of
rounds that a German will; and, what is more
to the point, they will all hit the mark.  Let
it be noted that the British Army owes this
perfection to the wise foresight of Lord
Roberts.  (Ah, if only the nation, too, had
listened to him!)
</p>

<p>
British troops, adopting the lessons of the
Boer War, attack with an interval between the
files, i.e. in extended order.
</p>

<p>
Now at Mons, and after, a German battalion
generally attacked in three double ranks.  The
rear double rank had with it four or six
machine-guns.  They count upon the first three or four
ranks stopping the enemy's bullets, but, by the
time these are swept away, the last ranks (with
the machine-guns) should be sufficiently near
to carry the position attacked: say about 300
yards.
</p>

<p>
This reckless sacrifice of life is typical of the
German "machine," as opposed to the British
"individual."
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact their method never
succeeded over open ground before the British
fire, for the front ranks were always swept away
at the very beginning of the attack, and so
they did not get near enough with the rear ranks.
</p>

<p>
The German officer who gave me these
details remarked that the rapidity and accuracy
of the British fire were simply incredible, that
they never had a chance.
</p>

<p>
"Our men," he said, "have come to believe
that every one of you carries a portable Maxim
with him."
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
It must have been about 2.30 in the afternoon
that Binche had to be abandoned.  But it
was before this that the German infantry attacks
began all along the line.
</p>

<p>
For nearly two hours our men had somehow
or other been weathering the storm of shrapnel,
and we have seen that they had by now settled
down under it.  Let us get back to the Second
Corps and see what is happening.  You have
got some idea of the look of the country in
front of our positions, all broken up, uneven
ground, little woods here and there.  Out on
the left flank there are county regiments, men
of Dorset, Norfolk, Suffolk, Cheshire, Surrey.
They know something about "ground" work,
and they have learned a deal more with their
regiments.
</p>

<p>
One end of the Yorks L.I. trench ends in
a little stone-walled pigsty.  At least it was a
pigsty about church time that morning, but
a German gunner thought it would look better
without any roof or walls.
</p>

<p>
There is still a fragment three feet high on
the weather side, and the Yorks C.O. finds it
a convenient shelter for the time being.  He
is not attending church-parade that day, so it
doesn't matter about lying full length in the
filth on the ground.  The last remaining
company colour-sergeant is with him&mdash;also
embedded in the manure.  They are both
nibbling chocolate.  Tobacco would be particularly
useful just now, but they have both run
out of it.
</p>

<p>
For some minutes the C.O. has been intently
watching through his glasses the corner
of a wood about 500 yards in front.  He
hands the binoculars to the sergeant.
</p>

<p>
"What do you make of it?  That corner
over the little shed."
</p>

<p>
The sergeant has a look.  He returns the
glasses and slowly nods.
</p>

<p>
"It might be a brigade, sir, from the
number of them."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," says the C.O., "I thought it was
about time.  Get word along that there is to
be no firing till the order's given."
</p>

<p>
"Very good, sir!" And the sergeant
scrambles to his feet, salutes, ducks hastily as
a shell seems to whistle past unnecessarily close,
and dives into the rabbit-burrow in which his men
are squatting.  The C.O. returns to his glasses.
</p>

<p>
The C.O. of a British battery, in position
some distance to the rear, has evidently also
spotted that particular target, for puffs of
bursting shrapnel have begun to appear over
the wood and round the edges.
</p>

<p>
Now there is a distinct movement of troops
emerging from behind the wood.  It is a
movement only which can be seen, for the men
themselves can scarcely be distinguished against
the grey-green country-side.
</p>

<p>
At the very same moment it seems as though
all the guns in the world have been turned on
to those few miles of British front, and to the
batteries behind.
</p>

<p>
The British gun-fire wavers for a minute or
so; but soon it picks up again though, alas! not
so strongly as before.
</p>

<p>
The Yorks C.O. has lost his enemy infantry
for a minute; they are working forward under
the edge of a rise in the ground.
</p>

<p>
Now the front ranks appear, and the C.O. gives
a sharp whistle of astonishment.  Four
hundred yards off, and it looks like a great
glacier rolling down a mountain-side.
</p>

<p>
Nearer still it creeps, and the German guns
have raised their range to give their infantry
a chance.  "Besides, there will probably be
nothing but empty trenches to take anyway,"
they say.
</p>

<p>
Fifty yards nearer, and the temptation is
too great.
</p>

<p>
"Let it go, Yorkshires!" he yells down the
trench.  (The command is not in the drill-book,
but it serves very well.)
</p>

<p>
And the Yorkshires "let it go" accordingly.
</p>

<p>
"Eh, lads," sings out a lad from Halifax,
"'tis t' crowd coom oop for t' Coop Day!  And
t' lads yonder can't shoot for nuts," he blithely
adds as myriads of rifle bullets whistle high
overhead.
</p>

<p>
And he and the lads from Trent-side proceed
very methodically to give "t' lads" from
Spreeside a lesson in how shooting should be done.
</p>

<p>
Very methodically; but that means something
like 16 shots a minute each man, and you
may be sure that very, very few bullets go off
the target.  No one dreams of keeping cover.
Indeed, the men prop their rifles on the parapet
and pump out lead as hard as their fingers can
work bolt and trigger.
</p>

<p>
Miss?  It's impossible to miss.  You can't
help hitting the side of a house&mdash;and that's
what the target looks like.  It is just slaughter.
The oncoming ranks simply melt away.
</p>

<p>
And now through the unholy din you can
hear a cracking noise which is quite distinct in
the uproar.  Something like the continuous
back-fire of a mammoth motor-cycle.  Machine-guns.
</p>

<p>
The Dorsets have got a man who is a past-master
in the use of these infernal engines.
How he escaped that day no one can tell.  But
for many an hour he sat at the gun spraying
the enemy attack with his steel hose.  His
"bag" must have run into thousands.
</p>

<p>
The attack still comes on.  Though hundreds,
thousands of the grey coats are mown
down, as many more crowd forward to refill
the ranks.
</p>

<p>
Nearer still, and with a hoarse yell the
Yorkshires, Dorsets, Cornwalls and others are
out of the trenches, officers ahead of them,
with bayonets fixed and heading straight at the
enemy.  A murderous Maxim fire meets them
but it does not stop them, and in a minute they
are thrusting and bashing with rifles, fists, stones,
in amongst the enemy ranks.
</p>

<p>
Again the German gunners drop their range
and pour their shells indiscriminately into friend
and foe.  It is too much for the attacking
regiments and they break up hopelessly, turn
and begin to struggle back.  It is impossible to
attempt any rally of our men.  They must go on
until they are overwhelmed by sheer numbers,
or they must straggle to the lines as best they
can in knots of twos and threes, or wander
aimlessly off to the flanks and get lost.
</p>

<p>
Such was one single attack.  But no sooner
was it broken than fresh regiments would march
out to begin it all over again.  And here is no
Pass of Thermopylae where a handful of men
can withstand for indefinite time an army.
What can the British hope to do against such
overwhelming numbers?  The end, you will say,
must be annihilation.
</p>

<p>
The cavalry, the only reserves, are working,
surely, as no cavalry has ever worked before.
Squadrons are everywhere at once.  Wherever
a gap is threatened they are there in support.
And wherever they go there also go the Horse
Gunners working hand and glove with them.
Charge and counter-charge upon the flanks of
the attacking infantry, dismounting to cover
with their fire a British infantry rally, fierce
hand-to-hand encounters with enemy squadrons.
Wherever they are wanted, each man and horse
is doing the work of ten.
</p>

<p>
But this cannot last for long.  Now it is
becoming only too evident that far from there
being a reasonable superiority against us the
British are everywhere along the line
hopelessly outnumbered in every arm.  And at
5 P.M. there happened one of the most
dramatic incidents of the war, that day or
afterwards.  You will find the bare recital of
the event set forth in cold official language
in the G.O.C.-in-Chief's dispatch, beginning:
"In the meantime, about 5 P.M., I received a
most unexpected message from General Joffre."
</p>

<p>
It will be remembered that from information
received from French G.H.Q. the previous
night, and from his own reconnaissance reports,
the Commander-in-Chief had concluded that
his right flank was reasonably secured by the
French armies, that the fortress of Namur was
still being held, and that the enemy strength
in front of him was about 134,000 men and
490 field-guns, at an outside estimate.
</p>

<p>
All the afternoon the enemy had been
attacking, and the British right had had to
give ground before it, with the consequence
that Mons itself had to be abandoned.
</p>

<p>
Now, like a bolt from the blue, came the
message from the French.  "Unexpected,"
one would think, is a very mild term:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Namur has fallen.  The Germans <i>yesterday</i>
won the passages over the River Sambre
between Charleroi and Namur.  The French
armies are retiring.  You have <i>at least</i> 187,500
men and 690 guns attacking you in front;
another 62,500 men and 230 guns trying to
turn your left flank; and probably another
300,000 men" (the victorious army in pursuit
of the French) "driving in a wedge on your
right."
</p>

<p>
This is what the message would look like:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-097a.jpg" alt="Attacking and defending forces" />

</p>

<p>
But we have seen that there were really
thirteen German corps attacking the positions
Tournai&mdash;Namur&mdash;Dinant.
</p>

<p>
Thus the <i>real</i> figures would probably look
like this:&mdash;

</p>

<p>
We may, of course, take it that by the end
of the day the figures were somewhat reduced
all round, British and German; the German
losses being "out of all proportion to those
which we have suffered."
</p>

<br />
PLAN B.  Position as it appeared at 5 pm Aug 23.
</p>

<p>
Such then was the situation at 5.0 P.M. on
that eventful Sunday.  An average of nearly
four times our number of guns against us all
along the position.  No wonder that senior
officers had guessed from the first that
"something was wrong."
</p>

<p>
And G.H.Q.?  You imagine, perhaps, that
the municipal offices where the General Staff
had its abode would now be seething with
excitement.  You will picture Staff officers
rushing from room to room; orders and
counter-orders being reeled off; the Intelligence
and Army Signals Departments looking
like Peter Robinson's in sales week; an army
of motor-cyclist dispatch riders being hurled
from the courtyard towards every point of the
compass.
</p>

<p>
Wrong!  G.H.Q. that day, and the next,
was less concerned than a little French
provincial mairie would be on France's national
fête day.  The casual visitor would have seen
less bustle of activity than at the Liverpool
offices of a shipping firm on mail day.
</p>

<p>
The Postal Department: "Business as
usual."  Army Censor: Not much doing.
Intelligence: Half a dozen red-tabbed officers
looking at big maps with blue and red
chalk-marks on them.  Director of Ordnance
Supplies: "Better see about moving rail-head a
few miles farther south."  A.G.'s (Adjutant-General)
Office: "We shall want orders out
about stragglers, what they are to do."  And
so on, all through the list.  If this was an
instance of that British phlegm which so
amuses the French, then commend me to it!
If anybody wanted a tonic against pessimism
these days of the Retreat he only had to drop
in at G.H.Q.  He would certainly come out
with the conviction that we should indeed be
home by Christmas, with the German Army
wiped off the map.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Yes, that week which followed, indeed,
welded into one "band of brothers" all the
officers and men in the little Force.  In those
days everybody seemed to know everybody else.
Regimental jealousy (if it ever existed) was
obliterated completely, and every officer and
man, from the General Officers Commanding
Corps down to the bus drivers who drove the
A.S.C. lorries, worked shoulder to shoulder.
And so we pulled through.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Now there were other units in the Force
besides those in the firing-line.  There were all
those columns which trekked up by road.
Normally, most of these should be something
like 15 miles to the rear.  They know very
little of what is going on ahead of them, though
the ammunition columns can gauge fairly well
by the demands made on them.
</p>

<p>
So it was that about midnight on that
Sunday they began to realise back there that
things were moving by a sudden and insistent
demand for every scrap of rifle and
18-pr. ammunition they carried.
</p>

<p>
No sooner was that sent than there came
more demands, and there was nothing to send.
Wagons and lorries had trundled off at once to
rail-head, but it would be hours before they
could get back.  Thus, on the very first day,
the overwhelming nature of the situation pulled
at and snapped the slender threads of communication.
The threads were soon mended, but, as
will be seen later, they never got properly into
working order until the Marne.
</p>

<p>
Nor did those columns altogether escape
disaster even at the very outset of the fighting.
One, out towards the flank, was attacked and
practically destroyed by raiding cavalry, for
they do not work with escorts.
</p>

<p>
In one column, about 10.0 P.M., the alarm
was given by an imaginative A.S.C. subaltern.
What the men were to fight with is not clear,
for only about 25 per cent. of the detachment
had ever handled a rifle, and no ammunition
was issued.
</p>

<p>
"It's Germans crawling through that field,"
said the subaltern.  "I saw their electric-torch
flashes."
</p>

<p>
The men stood to, peering into the darkness,
and feeling certain that their last hour
had come.
</p>

<p>
A farmer came slowly out of the field-gate
and begged two of the men to come and help
him round up his cows.
</p>

<p>
So the detachment turned in again, cursing
heartily.
</p>

<p>
But soon the A.S.C. bus drivers were
"doing their bit" under fire as gallantly as
everybody else.  How and when you shall hear
in another chapter.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
6.0 P.M.&mdash;The enemy have concentrated
their fire upon the town of Mons and it has
become untenable.
</p>

<p>
Only six hours, six little hours since the
Belgian townsfolk had come peacefully home
from Mass to their Sunday <i>déjeuner</i>, proud and
hopeful in the presence of their British allies.
And now their houses, their town, a heap of
smoking ruins.
</p>

<p>
In those short hours how many women have
seen their children crushed by falling walls or
blown to atoms by bursting shells?  How many
children are left helpless and alone in the world,
with no mother or father to take them by the
hand and guide them from the hell of destruction?
</p>

<p>
Is there no thought for them, you who have
been following the fortunes of the day for the
British?  Many have escaped, with such few
household treasures as they can carry in
perambulators and little handcarts.  They, at least,
have some hope of life.  These may struggle on
for a little while&mdash;to faint or die of hunger
and exhaustion by the roadside.  The strongest
may get through.
</p>

<p>
For the rest, their lives are sacrificed to
make a German holiday.  They die, but in their
death the battalions of these innocents have
joined the mighty, mysterious army of souls
who shall haunt the German people until
Germany ceases to be.
</p>

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
With such an overwhelming attack working
forward in front and on both flanks the only
problem left was how to get the British force
away with the smallest loss.  To remain
obviously meant certain annihilation sooner or
later.  As a matter of course, possible positions
in rear had long since been reconnoitred.  They
were not particularly good ones, but the best
that were available.
</p>

<p>
From earlier in the afternoon the Sappers
had been at work on all the bridges crossing the
canal, laying mines ready to blow them up in
front of a possible successful enemy advance.
By no means a pleasant task this, for the men
were working under heavy fire practically all
the time.  But the Sappers are another of those
corps of the Service which are well used to the
kicks without the ha'pence, and nothing comes
amiss to them.  There is no regiment in the
Army whose work merits recognition more than
the R.E.; there is no regiment more surprised
and pleased at receiving it.
</p>

<p>
As the dusk draws on the enemy fire has
slackened a little, and the men in their trenches
are here and there able to snatch mouthfuls of
any food they happen to have handy.  Most
of them have not tasted anything since early
morning, and they have been fighting hard all
day.  But there is no thought of rest.
</p>

<p>
The darkening night becomes red day as the
glare of burning houses and buildings everywhere
mounts to heaven in great shafts of light.
It is such a picture as only a Rembrandt could
give us on canvas.
</p>

<p>
The men sit or crouch wearily in their
burrows, rifles always ready, heads sunk
forward over the butts.  Now and again there is
a momentary stir as a doctor or stretcher-bearers
scramble through the debris to get at
the wounded.  The fantastic, twisted shapes of
the dead are reverently composed and laid down
on the ground.  The belongings of them are
carefully collected, with the little metal identity
disc.  So far as possible these will reach the
wife, mother, or sweetheart at home.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps those evening hours of the first
day's fighting were the most terrible the men
were ever to know.  The tension had very
slightly relaxed, and the brain began once again
something of its functions.  They began to
<i>feel</i> things.  No one ever gets accustomed to
being under the fire of modern warfare, and
this was the first day of it.  The horror of
everything began to crush the senses.  Soon
physical and mental action became purely
mechanical; men ceased to feel, but moved,
fired a rifle, fed themselves, with the grotesque
jerks of children's toys.  But this was not yet.
Now they were conscious, if but a little.
</p>

<p>
One man, a bugler in a county regiment,
little more than a child in years, went raving
mad as he staggered across a trench and fell,
dragging with him a headless Thing which still
kept watch with rifle against shoulder.  His
shrieks, as they pulled the two apart, ring even
now in the ears.  He died that night, simply
from shock after the awful tension of the day.
</p>

<p>
Consciousness came to the men, yet with it
came also amazing cheerfulness even in the
midst of the horror.  But it was the cheerfulness
not of high spirits but of determination,
and of pity.  They had fought through the day
against an enemy which, even to men who did
not understand, was in overwhelming strength;
and yet they had been able to hold their ground.
It was the cheerfulness which, at a word from
their officers, would have taken them straight
at the enemy's throat.
</p>

<p>
And pity, if it is to be helpful and sincere,
must have behind it a gaiety of heart.  No
man in the world is more tender to helpless or
dumb creatures than the British soldier or
sailor; no man more cheerful.  And no man in
the Force but felt his heart wrung by the
infinite pathos of the folk of Mons and round
it.  History will never record how many soldiers
lost their lives that day in succouring the people
who had put such trust in their presence.
</p>

<p>
And how many won such a distinction as no
king can bestow&mdash;the love and gratitude of little
children?  One man, at least, I knew (I never
learned his name) who, at the tears of two tiny
mites, clambered into the ruins of a burning
outhouse, then being shelled, to fetch something
they wanted, he could not understand what.
He found a terror-stricken cat and brought it
out safely.  No, not pussy, something else as
well.  Back he went again, and after a little
search discovered on the floor in a corner a
wicker cage, in it a blackbird.  Yes, that was
it.  And, oh, the joy of the girl mite at finding
it still alive!
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see, sir," he said afterwards,
"I've got two kiddies the image of them.
And it was no trouble, anyway."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
About 2 A.M. (the 24th) orders to begin
retiring were issued from G.H.Q.  Some four
hours before a few of the units&mdash;those north of
the canal&mdash;had begun to fall back; and so the
beginning of the move was made.  As the last
of these crossed the bridges the detonator fuses
were fired and the bridges blown up.
</p>

<p>
For the rest, the men crouched ever in
their places, bayonets fixed, rifles always
ready&mdash;waiting, waiting.

CHAPTER VIII
<br />
THE RETREAT BEGINS
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The poor condemned English,<br />
  Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires<br />
  Sit patiently, and inly ruminate<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
To follow now the fortunes of the British Force
you must imagine it, if you will, divided, like
Caesar's Gaul, into three parts.  There is the
First Corps, which still holds its position, save
that extreme right by Binche; there is the
Second Corps, which has begun at 3 A.M. to
retire to a new position; and there is the
Cavalry, Allenby's Division and the remainder
of Chetwode's Brigade, which turns up whereever
it is most needed to lend a helping hand.
</p>

<p>
If you glance through Sir John French's
dispatch (at the end of the book) you will see
that he had in mind to retire in what is called
"echelon" formation.  That is, one-half
retires and takes up a new position, while the
other half stays behind to act as a rear-guard
and hold up enemy attacks.  Then, in turn,
that other half retires behind the first half, and
so on.
</p>

<p>
That was the idea, and on the first day it
worked very well.  But after that it was found
simply impossible to keep to it, partly through
the enemy's thunderbolt movements, and
partly because our men became more and more
exhausted.
</p>

<p>
Now, it is also a cardinal principle in
rearguard fights that you must not only check your
enemy, but must also, whenever possible, make
a counter-attack.  In fact, the counter-attacks
are part and parcel of the checking movements.
This is where cavalry comes in very useful.
</p>

<p>
Let us, then, take the three divisions of the
Force separately.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>The First Corps</i>
</p>

<p>
Night attacks, especially in the early morning
(it sounds rather Irish), are horribly
uncomfortable things.  The nerves are continuously
on edge and you are apt to loose off guns or
rifles at the merest suspicion of a movement.
</p>

<p>
"If ye should see a wee brrown beastie in
frront o' ye," a canny Scot sergeant told his
men, "ye mauna fire, because likely it'll be a
bit rrabbit, and rrabbits are guid for the pot.
But if the beastie should walk upon twa legs,
then ye may ken it's no a rrabbit, but a
Gerrman, an' ye will tak a verry quick but
carefu' sicht o' him."
</p>

<p>
All through that Sunday night the men had
snatched odd minutes of sleep just where they
had fought through the day.  And very little
rest did the enemy allow them.  For one can
well imagine how exasperated by this time the
enemy were at being held up by a handful of
a "contemptible little army."  It was most
difficult, too, to get any food up to the lines,
for the German guns had "registered" all the
approaches and persistently dropped their shells
across them.
</p>

<p>
But the men hung on cheerily enough, and
if they couldn't get any sleep they made up
their minds that the Germans should not either,
especially where they were dug in only a few
hundred yards in front.
</p>

<p>
So the short summer night was passed.
And with the first hint of dawn the news ran
quickly round that, far from dreaming of
retiring, the First Corps was going to attack.  The
news was as good as a big breakfast.  Somehow
or other the A.S.C. got up rations to most of
the units, and so it was the cheeriest of 2nd
Divisions which swung out of their trenches and
loop holed houses and headed for the enemy's
left flank in Binche.  The 1st Division acted
as supports.
</p>

<p>
In the attack there was something more of
a hint of that method and timing which, eight
months later, were brought to such perfection in
Flanders.  The British batteries had by now
recovered somewhat from their severe handling
during the day, and at the given moment every
gun got well to work in support of the infantry,
and very fine practice they made.
</p>

<p>
Of course the attack was really no more
than a ruse, daringly conceived and successfully
executed.  Binche could not have been held
even if it had been recaptured.  But it is not
difficult to imagine the enemy's astonishment
at finding an Army Corps, which they had fondly
imagined as good as wiped out, coming to life
again and actually having the cheek to attack
them.  Kipling's remark about the Fuzzy-wuzzy
who is "generally shamming when 'e's dead"
was an excellent motto for that morning's work.
</p>

<p>
When the attack was well launched General
Lomax began to withdraw very carefully some
of his regiments from the supporting 1st
Division.  The task of the British guns of the
two divisions (working together) was to lower
such a curtain of fire in front of the 2nd
Division as to make it as difficult as possible
for the enemy to counter-attack or, indeed, to
advance at all.  As soon as the 1st Division have
retired a little, it will be the turn of the division
which has made that excellent sortie.
</p>

<p>
It is easy enough to say "the guns will
check an enemy advance," but think for a
moment what that means.  There is already a
big enemy superiority in guns, and, what is
more, these have already got the ranges to a
nicety.
</p>

<p>
Our batteries, or most of them, were in quite
good positions, but at this early date we had
not yet learned the art of concealing them
sufficiently.  The enemy aircraft were very
active, and against them our own aircraft were
hopelessly outnumbered.  And so it was not
long before our guns were "spotted," with the
inevitable result.
</p>

<p>
Imagine, then, how gloriously those gun
detachments must have worked to have
accomplished what they did that day, "enabling Sir
Douglas Haig, with the First Corps, to reach
the new line without much further loss about
7 P.M."  For it was undoubtedly the devotion
of the guns which made possible this and
succeeding retirements.  Unless facts like this
are realised, the astonishing work of the Force
in its retreat can never be appreciated.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>The Second Corps</i>
</p>

<p>
If that Monday was an anxious day for Sir
Douglas Haig, what must it have been for
General Smith-Dorrien and his men?  One
looks hopelessly at the blank writing-pad in
despair of giving even the most primitive
description of the anxiety, the work, and the
accomplishment of it.
</p>

<p>
Here is a Corps which has gone through,
for the first time, the awful ordeal of a day's
modern shell-fire and massed infantry attack.
The men have supped full of horrors, and, at
3 A.M., hungry, weary and with nerves stretched
to their utmost tension, they have received
orders to move.  There is not a regiment which
has not lost heavily, especially in officers, and
there is not a man but receives the command
with his senses tangled in bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
Now it should be remembered that up to
this time all our dispositions had been made for
an advance.  The impedimenta to the rear of the
firing-line were so arranged that they might the
more easily follow up a British attack.  There
was no real thought of retiring.  The British
were in the place of honour on the left of the
line, and intended, with our French comrades,
to drive the enemy back again through Belgium.
I will not say that all this was a foregone
conclusion, but at least it was "confidently
anticipated."  Remembering this, you will perhaps
realise more vividly how staggering were the
contents of that telegram from French G.H.Q.
The work, therefore, of clearing the roads
of the transport was exceedingly difficult.  This
devolves upon the Q.M.G.'s department, and
General Smith-Dorrien has placed on record
the wholly admirable way in which it was
accomplished by General Ryecroft and his Staff.
But proper Staff work for all the retiring troops
during the hours of darkness was even more
complicated.
</p>

<p>
Thus some few of the companies, with no one
to guide them, start off in the wrong direction
and march straight into the German lines; they
are shot or captured.  Others wander off to the
east, struggle painfully through the shell-fire
on Mons, and drift into their comrade ranks of
the First Corps.  Others, again, march off to
the west, and are hopelessly lost; they are
either captured by the flanking German corps
or they get through and meet with friendly
peasants, to turn up eventually at base ports
or other towns.
</p>

<p>
Night marching across unknown country is
not always easy in peace time, with guides at
the heads of columns.  Now there was the added
confusion of the crowds of emigrants, a perfect
network of roads to choose from, and, above
all, continual alarms of enemy attacks which
the British had to turn to meet.  The whole
of the night and all the Monday was one long
period of marching, fighting, marching and
fighting.
</p>

<p>
Early in the morning another infantry
brigade, the 19th, arrived by railway, detraining
at Valenciennes, and it is no exaggeration
to say that the men went straight off the
trains into the thick of the fight.  It was
a very welcome reinforcement of about 4,000 men.
</p>

<p>
By 8 A.M. the enemy had burst through
Mons, across the canal line, and were in hot
pursuit in overwhelming numbers.  Away on
the left flank they had attacked Tournai, which
was occupied by French Territorials and also, I
believe, by a British battery, though how it got
there, or why, I do not know.  That bit of
fighting was over by midday with the capture
of the town and the destruction or capture of
its defenders.  The Germans were then free to
resume their victorious advance.
</p>

<p>
About the middle of the morning, then, the
line of the Second Corps extended from a little
Belgian village called Frameries, five miles
S.W. of Mons, through the village of Dour.
The right flank was the more forward, partly
because the regiments there had to encounter
the more furious attacks and could not break
away.
</p>

<p>
It was at this point that there was made
one more of those splendid but hopeless cavalry
charges of which we so often read in military
history.  It is, curiously enough, almost the
only definite incident mentioned by Sir John
French in his dispatch.  But the incident, or
rather the sequel to it, caught the public
imagination, mainly because of the fine work
of that most gallant gentleman, Francis
Grenfell.
</p>

<p>
Of all the noble, lion-hearted men who
have "gone west" in this bloody war, no
man more worthily deserves the description
applied to the Chevalier Bayard, "<i>sans peur
et sans reproche</i>," than Francis Grenfell&mdash;he
and one other whom I shall name hereafter.
Gallant soldier, brilliant sportsman, graceful
poet, and true lover of Nature, a genuine
statesman in his dealings with men, and the most
loyal of friends, he died later on the field of
honour, and Britain&mdash;nay, the world is the
poorer for his loss.
</p>

<p>
The charge was made by the 9th Lancers,
which regiment, with others of the 2nd Brigade,
had been moved forward to ease the pressure on
the right flank.
</p>

<p>
About 400 yards from the German infantry
and guns the Lancers galloped full tilt into
barbed wire.  There was nothing for it but to
swerve across the German front.  How a single
man or horse escaped the hail of shell and
bullets which was turned on them one can
never understand.  But a poor remnant, under
Captain Francis Grenfell, did indeed get across,
mercilessly pursued by that storm of lead, and
eventually found some little shelter under a
railway embankment.
</p>

<p>
A R.F.A. battery was in action here.  At
least, the guns were still there, but officers and
detachments had been gradually wiped out until
there were just one officer and two detachments
left to work the battery.  It was only a matter
of minutes before the remainder must be killed
and the guns fall into the hands of the enemy,
for the German guns had the range and the
German infantry were crowding up.
</p>

<p>
The 9th Lancers and the Gunners are old
friends, and the Lancers do not leave old
friends (or new ones) to finish a losing fight
alone.
</p>

<p>
"The Germans don't get those guns while
any of us are left," said Grenfell.  "I'm off to
see how we can get them away."
</p>

<p>
Now Grenfell was already badly wounded,
but he stuck on his horse somehow and <i>walked</i>
that gallant beast out into the storm to see
where he was to run the guns to.  (Why does
not His Majesty create a decoration for horses?
But I'll wager Grenfell hung his V.C. round
his charger's neck a month later.)
</p>

<p>
Well, he walked him out and he walked him
back, just to show his men what poor shots the
Germans were.
</p>

<p>
"Now then," said Grenfell, "who's for
the guns?"
</p>

<p>
And, since (as I have said) the Lancers
always stand by old pals, every man of them was.
</p>

<p>
They tied their horses up, and Lancers and
Gunners set to work.  One by one of those
guns they got at the wheels and trails and
worked and worked.  Down went more gallant
Lancers and more gallant Gunners, but there
were still a few left, and, by Heaven, those few
stuck to it.
</p>

<p>
"Come on, lads, just one more!" sang out
Grenfell, with his coat off.
</p>

<p>
And they worked and heaved, and did it.
Every one of those guns they saved.
</p>

<p>
But then, be it repeated, the Lancers and
Gunners always were good pals.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
By midday General Smith-Dorrien's task
had become one of the gravest difficulty.  And
this was but the opening phase of a movement
which, I venture to think, will be accounted by
the historian as one of the most astonishing
pieces of work in military history.  I refer not
to the Retreat as a whole, but to the work of
the Second Corps and its leader from 3 A.M. of
the 24th to about midnight of the 26th&mdash;27th.
An eternity of years was encircled by those few
hours.
</p>

<p>
The difficulties of the movement can probably
be appreciated at their full value only by
the military student with a vivid imagination,
so I will just suggest what had to be done.
First of all, General Smith-Dorrien had to get
his men away from the Mons line in the early
dawn in the face of overwhelming numbers,
numbers which he could only guess at, for at
any moment a big attack might be made by
another army upon his left flank.  This was
very much complicated by his men having been
severely handled all through the Sunday, and
getting no food nor rest.  In fact, it was the
human element which really made all the
movement so difficult.  The feeling that at any
moment the tremendous strain upon the men's
endurance would stretch to breaking-point and
snap.
</p>

<p>
Then the G.O.C. had not merely to get his
men gradually back, but they had to show a bold
front the whole time.  It was a matter of
fighting backwards without a moment's rest.  A
couple of regiments, say, with some cavalry,
would halt for half an hour on a certain line,
and hold up with the heaviest fire they could
the attack on their particular section.  Then,
when the enemy got nearer, up they would
jump and go straight at the Germans with the
bayonet, the cavalry backing them up all they
knew.  The same with the guns.
</p>

<p>
A battery would manoeuvre into a position,
come into action, and pound away for a quarter
of an hour.  Then, at the right moment (and it
called for the nicest judgment to select that
moment) four guns would be run back, limbered
up, and got away, while the remaining couple
would continue an intermittent fire to cover the
retirement.  These in turn would slip away&mdash;if
they could.
</p>

<p>
The casualties under conditions like these
must, of course, be very heavy indeed.  That
they were not infinitely heavier was due to the
splendid use the men made of the ground,
taking cover and so on, and to the noble spirit
of self-sacrifice for comrades which animated
every unit.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, the G.O.C. had to remember that
he was not playing a lone hand, but that he
had to consider the retirement of the First
Corps on his right.  He had to play the match
for his side.  Just at the moment Jessop,
in the person of Sir Douglas Haig, was in
with him, and Jessop had to hit out against
time to make the runs while Leveson-Gower
(Smith-Dorrien) kept up his wicket at the
other end.
</p>

<p>
And, fourthly, to carry on the metaphor,
when Jessop was forced to "retire hurt"
Leveson-Gower had to begin to hit at just
that moment when he felt that he had "collared
the bowling."  In other words, the G.O.C.,
having held a certain line of defence for a
couple of hours or so, had to judge to a nicety
the exact moment when he had, for the time,
broken the enemy's attack sufficiently to permit
of retirement another two miles to the next
position.
</p>

<p>
Those four points, then, constitute in very
broad outline the task which General
Smith-Dorrien had to perform.  Our people have not
been slow to recognise how magnificently he
and his men accomplished it.
</p>

<p>
The enemy were now, by accident or design,
beginning to drive in a wedge at Frameries
between the two corps.  Always a serious situation,
especially when, as now, units had become
very scattered in the gradual retirement.  The
gap was filled to some extent by the 5th Brigade,
which General Smith-Dorrien borrowed from
the First Corps.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
Impressions gleaned from the other side are
always of interest.  Another German officer,
whom we got a few days later, gave me his
opinion of the British work somewhat like
this.
</p>

<p>
"All our text-books," he said, "about
rear-guard actions will have to be rewritten,
and you have certainly taught us a lesson.  It
has been just like advancing into a wall of fog.
The fog is elastic enough when one enters it,
but soon it clings all round and chokes you.
We pushed in all right, but never came out
at the other side."
</p>

<p>
Personally, I felt inclined to apply the
metaphor the reverse way, and that is how the
men felt it.  The dense, overpowering cloud
rolling down, the battling against it with
impotent arms, and the fog penetrating into
every gap in the lines.
</p>

<p>
The men were dazed, stunned by the
continuous onslaughts.  There seemed no end to
them.  As fast as one German company was
mown down another would spring up.  It was
as though their aircraft flew over with watchful
eye to sow in every field another bushel of the
mythical dragon's teeth.  And everywhere more
and more German guns would come into action
to support their infantry, and everywhere more
and more machine-guns would be rushed up by
their very mobile transport to rake and enfilade
the British companies or gun detachments.
</p>

<p>
At the time all these things were not
realised, for there was no sitting down for five
minutes to ruminate.  But now, after eighteen
months, when one pieces together this fact and
that, and learns something of what the actual
numbers were, one hesitates to set it down on
paper for fear of being flatly disbelieved.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Any record of feelings during those hours
is blurred.  But there was one thought which,
I know, was uppermost in every man's mind:
"Where on earth are the French?"
</p>

<p>
When a thought like that has been born it
is easy to guess how it will grow and run
through the ranks.  If only now and again they
had seen a French squadron swoop down upon
the enemy's flank in front of them everything
would have been well.  They would have cheered
their French comrades on, and gone in for all
they were worth to avenge their death, if called
upon.  But never a French soldier did one of
our lads see.
</p>

<p>
So far as I know, our Allies have published
no official account of their retreat from Namur,
although they have very frankly admitted, in
an official Government report, the mistakes
which were then made and have shown how they
were since rectified.  It is by no means clear
what happened to the 5th French Army on
our right after Namur had fallen; we only knew
that we never saw them.
</p>

<p>
But at the time it must be remembered that
no one in the British Force, save G.H.Q., knew
what was happening even to themselves, so it
was hardly likely that they could learn anything
definite about the French.  So there the subject
may rest.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In the early afternoon General Smith-Dorrien
learned that the First Corps had
"made good" during the morning, and were
fighting their way back with sufficient success
to admit of his own retirement when he was
able to break away.
</p>

<p>
Although, perhaps, too little space has been
given in this chapter to the work of the First
Corps, they had nearly as hard a fight as the
rest of the Force.  The task before Sir Douglas
Haig was probably not quite so delicate as
General Smith-Dorrien's, but it was obviously
one of as grave a responsibility.  However, in
the late afternoon he got safely back, as we have
seen, to the position determined by the
Commander-in-Chief.
</p>

<p>
The Second Corps then succeeded in breaking
away, and by the evening a new line of the
entire Force was formed, reaching from the
fortress of Maubeuge on the right to two little
villages, Bry and Jenlain, on the left.  The
19th Brigade, which had come into the fight in
the morning, was posted on and across the
extreme left.
</p>

<p>
It should be noted that, with the fall of
Tournai and the destruction of the French
troops in that neighbourhood, the whole
country on the west was open to the invaders.
Their victorious army corps operating there
was now able to swing round to attack the
British left, and their cavalry was already
sweeping in flying squadrons and patrols over
the country-side.  In fact, the French Channel
ports, from Boulogne to Havre, were there for
the taking, and the French coast line, for which
the enemy fought so valiantly a few months
later, would have been theirs without a
struggle.
</p>

<p>
But these facts were only vaguely realised
in the Force, and the men, of course, knew
nothing of doings save only upon their
immediate front.  At every moment they fully
expected to make a definite stand, with an
advance to follow, and thus they remained in
good heart, secure in the conviction that though
badly mauled they were not even at the
beginning of a defeat.  But some of us knew and
realised, and it was a hard task to keep the
knowledge from the men and from the friendly
country-folk.

CHAPTER IX
<br />
THE SECOND DAY
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Gloucester, 'tis true that we are in great danger;<br />
  The greater, therefore, should our courage be.&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . . God Almighty!<br />
  There is some soul of goodness in things evil,<br />
  Would men observingly distil it out.<br />
  For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers,<br />
  Which is both healthful and good husbandry.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
During the night of Monday the whole Force
was on or about the line already indicated,
with the fortress of Maubeuge on their right
flank.  But let it not be imagined that the men
settled down quietly at 9 P.M. to a cosy supper
with a night's sleep to follow.  There was no
such thing as a halt for any time.  Incidentally,
most of the horses went through the whole
business without being off-saddled once.  The
first regiments in were the first to move off
again.  The men just dropped down in the road
where they halted and, if lucky, snatched ten
minutes' sleep.  Many of the men seemed to
sleep while they marched; although, as one has
often done it on night manoeuvres at home,
there was nothing curious about that.
</p>

<p>
By midnight I do not think that anybody
very much cared what happened.  There was a
certain amount of trench digging going on, and
there was, in consequence, some idea that a
stand would be made.  But the men were really
too exhausted to care one way or the other.
</p>

<p>
It is all very well to remark upon their
invariable cheeriness, as most writers seem to
delight in doing, but it gives a hopelessly wrong
impression of the hardships.  A certain form of
"cheery spirit" is inseparable from the British
soldier when he is up against a tough job, but
you can't very well be lively and make funny
remarks (as reported in the Press) when you
have become an automaton in all your movements.
</p>

<p>
Had the French held firm, in all probability
a stand would have been made on this line.
But there is no object in speculating about it
now.  The view adopted by the Commander-in-Chief,
which determined a further retreat,
may best be given in his own words:
</p>

<p>
"The French were still retiring, and I had
no support except such as was afforded by the
fortress of Maubeuge; and the determined
attempts of the enemy to get round my left
flank assured me that it was his intention to
hem me against that place and surround me.
I felt that not a moment must be lost in retiring
to another position."
</p>

<p>
"I hoped," he adds, "that the enemy's
pursuit would not be too vigorous to prevent
me effecting my object."
</p>

<p>
This hope was, fortunately, fulfilled, and
the second day's retirement was, on the
whole, less eventful.  Later I will hazard a
suggestion why it was so.
</p>

<p>
The necessary orders had been given overnight
to be clear of the Valenciennes&mdash;Bavai&mdash;Maubeuge
road by 5.30 A.M.  The Second
Corps got clear by the time specified, but the
First Corps could only begin their move at that
hour, and so got behind.  This fact tended to
make inevitable the fight which took place that
evening at Landrecies.
</p>

<p>
It was, as I remember, a baking hot day,
with a blazing sun in a cloudless sky.  Along
English country roads and through our own
little dappled-grey villages it would have been
trying enough; but French roads, built Roman
fashion, do not try to be picturesque and
charming, and they certainly have no sense of
humour like ours.  Thus, the day's march was
simply purgatory to a tired force.  The fruit
trees with their harvest really saved the
situation.  But, oh, those green apples and pears!
</p>

<p>
Once again, do not imagine the regiments
trekking along straight for their next destination.
The day was less eventful only in comparison
with Monday and Wednesday.  It was
a rear-guard action most of the way, and
there was quite enough fighting to break the
monotony, with some big cavalry actions and
the 5th Brigade heavily engaged.
</p>

<p>
Take, for instance, a field battery in the
2nd Division.  The time-table would be
something like this: 5.30 A.M., open fire; 6, cease
fire and limber up; 6.10, en route to new
position; 6.30, halt, open fire; 6.40, cease fire,
limber up, and start off for new position; 7.15,
halt, open fire; and so on all through the day.
In fact, that was the ordinary day's programme.
The particular battery I have in mind had
a little adventure all to itself on Tuesday.  It
is of interest as revealing another side of German
thoroughness.
</p>

<p>
The battery was in action, but had
temporarily ceased firing, and the detachments
were lying by the guns.
</p>

<p>
A big grey "Sunbeam" drew up on a road
to the flank of the battery, and a couple of
red-tabbed Staff officers jumped out, walked up to
the nearest gun, and started to chat with one
of the gunners.
</p>

<p>
After a few remarks about how well the
battery had been doing, they asked some
questions about casualties, positions of
neighbouring batteries, the infantry near them, and
the usual facts which the Staff come to inquire
about.
</p>

<p>
The major had been watching from the far
flank, and, as the Staff officers turned to get
into their car, he remarked to the sergeant-major:
</p>

<p>
"I don't quite like the look of those two
officers; there's something wrong about
them."  And he had a look through his glasses.
</p>

<p>
Some distance along the road there was
marching down a company of R.E.'s.
</p>

<p>
"Call up those sappers (by flag) and tell
them to hold up that car."
</p>

<p>
The sergeant-major repeated the message to
the flag-wagger.
</p>

<p>
"Stop grey car&mdash;suspicious."
</p>

<p>
The R.E. sergeant ran up to the subaltern
in charge:
</p>

<p>
"Battery signals 'stop grey car.'"
</p>

<p>
"Well, stop it, then," replied the subaltern
irritably.
</p>

<p>
So the grey car was stopped, very much to
the annoyance of two Staff officers who were in
a great hurry to get back to G.H.Q.
</p>

<p>
"Very sorry, sir," said the subaltern, "but
it's a telegraph message from that battery.  The
O.C. has probably got something special to
send to G.H.Q."  And the car was escorted
back again.
</p>

<p>
The O.C. had "something special to send"
in the shape of a couple of German officers,
very carefully disguised as British.  A drum-head
court-martial was held at Corps H.Q., and
as the Germans in question were hopelessly
compromised by the very full notes which they
had managed to collect from various units about
the Force, the case was clear.
</p>

<p>
"Guilty.  To be shot at dawn."
</p>

<p>
They were plucky fellows, but&mdash;well, a spy
is a spy, and that's all about it.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Less than a week before the country folk
had watched with delight and relief the passing
of mighty transport columns of British, had
welcomed and cheered the men forward, proud and
confident in the anticipation of early victory.
</p>

<p>
Now imagine their feelings, their alarm, at
the sight of British regiments, war-worn, weary
and battered, trailing back as fast as they could
move.
</p>

<p>
Of what use was it to tell them that this
was only a strategical retirement?  Panic
spreads quickly, and once the hint of calamity
is given it is impossible to check the alarm.
</p>

<p>
But even then it was some little time before
the stolid peasants of Northern France could
grasp the meaning of what they saw, and I
remember well how the inhabitants of a certain
little village crowded out to watch the
extraordinary (to them) behaviour of a regiment
which was in the extreme rear of the retiring
First Corps.
</p>

<p>
The village overlooked a valley, and there
was a splendid view of the British lines retiring
in open order up the hill towards the little
hamlet.  They came up panting heavily and,
just under the brow of the hill, set to work to
dig up some rough shelter.  The folk stood
watching, laughing and talking, until an
exasperated lance-corporal threw his tool in front of
an oldish man.
</p>

<p>
"'Ere, it's about b&mdash;&mdash; well time <i>you</i> did
a bit"; and the corporal sat down to wipe off
some of the dirt from his face.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes all the men and women
had started digging as though for buried
treasure, and the British sat still for a spell and
encouraged them with happy comments.
</p>

<p>
Very soon down the opposite slope
thousands of little grey-blue ants came swiftly,
and from the ridge behind them dim flashes
shot out.
</p>

<p>
"Now, then, you'd better 'op it!" said the
lance-corporal.
</p>

<p>
And even then they didn't understand what
those ants really were.
</p>

<p>
"Allmonds!" was the lance-corporal's
laconic remark.
</p>

<p>
The arrival of a shell settled it, and the
villagers ran helter-skelter for their houses
and little treasures.  In a quarter of an hour
another pitiable reinforcement had joined the
ranks of the refugee army flying southwards,
and only the old curé remained, ever true to
his charge.  They were gallant gentlemen those
French curés, and bravely they faced the death
which nearly always overtook them at the hands
of those murderers.
</p>

<p>
It was not until the British had turned to
advance from the Marne that they began fully
to realise the nature of the Germans.  As yet
they encountered no evidence of the atrocious,
bestial work of the enemy.  But already rumour
was busy, and even on this day I had recorded
authentic details that the Germans were placing
women and children before their advancing
infantry, and that they were stabbing the wounded
with the bayonet.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On the Sunday another British Division,
the 4th, had arrived at Le Cateau, the little
town to which the Force was now moving.
This meant a reinforcement of some 14,500
men, together with three field batteries.  They
were there waiting to come into action on the
Wednesday, and in the meantime had begun to
entrench.
</p>

<p>
The general line of retirement on the Tuesday was:
</p>

<p>
(<i>a</i>) First Corps, Bavai&mdash;Maubeuge, to Landrecies&mdash;Maroilles.
</p>

<p>
(<i>b</i>) Second Corps, Bry&mdash;Bavai, to west of Le
Cateau.
</p>

<p>
A glance at the picture-map will show
the position of these places.  It will be noted
that the various divisions kept together pretty
well.  Also that between Landrecies and Le
Cateau there was a gap in the line which the
6th Brigade could not properly fill.  The
Commander-in-Chief remarks in his dispatch that
the men in the First Corps were too exhausted
to march farther so as to cover this gap.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
You picture, then, the regiments arriving
one by one at the end of that most exhausting
day.  The men dog-tired, hardly able to drag
their feet over the burning ground, no proper
meal since a hasty breakfast at dawn, fighting
on and off all day, and now simply done to the
world.
</p>

<p>
Now, it is a golden rule in the Service that,
however tired the men may be, they must set
to work at the end of their march to entrench
themselves or otherwise prepare against possible
attack.  I leave it to your imagination to realise
the meaning of "discipline" when you learn
that the men did entrench themselves that
evening.  And never was that rule more finely
vindicated.
</p>

<p>
I conceive Marshal von Kluck at German
G.H.Q. soliloquising that Tuesday morning
something in this wise:
</p>

<p>
"My friends von Buelow and Hausen have
between them settled with the French on this
side, and <i>they</i> won't give any more trouble.
Von Buelow and I have pretty well pounded
and demoralised the English, and one more
effort should finish <i>them</i>.  Now, I will just give
them enough to keep them busy through
to-day, keep them on the run and exhaust
them thoroughly, and then to-night we'll
have a really hot attack and crumple up the
First Corps.  They'll never stand that; and
we shall then have the rest of their army
surrounded."?
</p>

<p>
And that is the suggestion about the day's
work which I venture to make.  We have seen
how the daylight hours went for the British,
and how the Force drifted in to their
destinations.  Now we will see how von Kluck
crumpled up the First Corps with his night
attack.
</p>

<p>
The 1st Division was halted in and about
Maroilles, and the 2nd Division at Landrecies.
They were therefore on the extreme right of
the line, with their flank more or less "in the
air," for no French seemed to be near.
Landrecies was held by the 4th Brigade, battalions
of the Foot Guards, Grenadiers, Coldstreams
and Irish, under General Scott-Kerr.
</p>

<p>
The torrid heat of the day had been the
prelude to a cool, rainy evening.  Room was
found for about two-thirds of the Brigade in
the houses and halls of the little town&mdash;a typical
French country-town, with its straight streets
and market-place.  The remainder of the men
got what little comfort they could on a rainy
night outside.
</p>

<p>
By 9 P.M. they had hardly begun to settle
down, after "clearing decks for action"&mdash;in
case.  Outposts had been placed, and the men
were congratulating themselves on a
comfortable shelter after so many nights of foot
slogging.  At 9.30 lights were out, and town
and country-side were in pitch darkness.
</p>

<p>
A battalion of the Coldstream Guards had
not yet arrived, but was about a quarter of a
mile from the town, marching in.  The colonel
was at the head of the column with the guide.
This man persisted in flashing an electric torch
to and fro towards the left, and the
C.O. peremptorily ordered him to put it out.
</p>

<p>
The man obeyed for a few yards, and then
flashed the light again.
</p>

<p>
The C.O. at once grasped the situation,
drew his revolver, and shot the spy dead.
</p>

<p>
It was as though that bullet had been fired
straight into a mountain of gunpowder.
</p>

<p>
With a terrific crash German guns opened
fire.  Simultaneously, on front and flank, rifles
and machine-guns blazed out.
</p>

<p>
A German night attack is no question of
feeling a way in open order until the enemy's
outposts are driven in; it comes down like a
smith's hammer on the anvil.
</p>

<p>
The Coldstreamers, with miraculous discipline,
swung round and got into a kind of line
with the outposts already there, then continued
retirement to the town at the double.
</p>

<p>
The outpost line was crushed through almost
in a moment like tissue paper, and before
anyone could grasp what was happening the
Germans were pouring their massed columns into
the town.
</p>

<p>
Thus began perhaps the most critical and
certainly the most remarkable fight in which
British regiments have ever been engaged.
</p>

<p>
Tired out, the men tumbled out of the
houses; three privates and a corporal here, a
dozen men and a sergeant there, a subaltern, a
private and a machine-gun at another corner,
half a dozen men at two first-floor windows
somewhere else.  And the only light came from
the flash of the rifles.
</p>

<p>
There was no idea of forming ranks, even
had it been possible.  Slowly, steadily up the
streets the great German mammoth crept, and,
like tigers at their prey, the men of the Guards
sprang at head and flanks, worrying with
grim-set teeth to the heart of the beast.
</p>

<p>
Now the British machine-guns opened fire
straight upon the head of the column, swept it
away, swept the succeeding ranks, until the
mass was brought to a standstill.
</p>

<p>
More Guardsmen threw themselves straight
at the ranks, firing as they could, crashing in
with bayonet and clubbed rifle.
</p>

<p>
Now the column shivers; but the Germans
are brave men.  They rally, for their comrades
are pouring into the town to help them.  Up
side streets and lanes, by all the approaches they
come, and everywhere the men of the Guards
spring at them.
</p>

<p>
But surely numbers must tell.  What can
four battered regiments, fighting by handfuls,
do in face of such thousands of a fresh army
corps!
</p>

<p>
From Maroilles right down the line the
British are fighting for their lives, for von Kluck
has staked heavily on this throw, and it would
seem that the dice are loaded.  He pushes his
guns up still closer until some are firing into
the town almost at point-blank range.  Again,
what does it matter if his own men are swept
away?  There are thousands more to fill their
places.
</p>

<p>
The houses have begun to blaze fiercely in
the torrents of rain, and there is plenty of light
at last.  And now the Guards rally for a
supreme effort.  The last, the forlorn hope&mdash;but
it is the Guards, and at least they will go
down fighting to the last man.
</p>

<p>
One mighty heave&mdash;in at them&mdash;again&mdash;they
are breaking&mdash;heave!
</p>

<p>
They have done it.  Broken them.  Driven
them out.  And behind them the enemy leave
close upon 1,000 dead.
</p>

<p>
Away up by Maroilles Sir Douglas Haig has
fought his men like one possessed, and there,
too, he has broken the German attack, just as
two French Reserve Divisions came up to his aid.
</p>

<p>
Slowly, sullenly, von Kluck withdraws his
legions.  Slowly and fitfully the firing dies
away, and by 2 A.M. all is still once more.

AN INTERLUDE

  <i>... As many ways meet in one town;<br />

<p>
There is something more than magic in the
poetry of Shakespeare's <i>Henry V.</i> when it is
read to illustrate the stirring events of these
opening phases of the War.  To set it side by
side with the recital of the story is to listen to
the voice of a singer supported by the
gravely-sounding, deep-toned brass instruments of an
orchestra.
</p>

<p>
There is more than beauty of accompaniment,
there is the magic of prophecy.  I can
hardly find an incident of those August days
which was not mirrored three centuries ago in
the verse of this play.  Thus, I have sought
in no other for the musical preludes of my
chapters; and I confess often to have rubbed
my eyes in astonishment at the aptness of the
poetry to the incidents of the moment.
</p>

<p>
Now those few bars of introduction suggest
another <i>motif</i>; let me try to expand the theme
a little.
</p>

<p>
In reading the cold, semi-official language
which states that the British Force halted at
such and such an hour along a line extending
from So-and-So to Somewhere, one is apt to
gain an impression which is far removed from
reality.
</p>

<p>
You picture, perhaps, the various units
retiring along routes carefully assigned by
gilded Staff officers, and duly arriving at the
scheduled times in various villages and hamlets.
That there they are met by courteous billeting
parties, who proceed to allot the men to more
or less unwilling householders.  That at the
hour specified in the report you find the Dorsets
in one place, the Irish Guards next to them, the
batteries with their guns neatly parked, and so
on all down the line.  The various H.Q.'s of
Brigades, Divisions or Corps all in readily
accessible spots, and everybody connected up
with everybody else by telegraph or telephone,
so that any unit can be set in motion at any
minute.
</p>

<p>
That is the ideal.  Well, that delightful
ideal first assumed definite shape after the Battle
of the Marne and not before.  Here is a little
sketch of a tiny village on the line of retreat
on the evening of Tuesday, August 25th:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
M. le maire, old Pierre Godolphin, sat
slowly pulling at a new clay pipe as he looked
with unseeing eyes up the long dusty road which
led out of the village away over the northern
uplands.  A trimly kept hedge of privet
bordered his rose-garden and the road, and his
favourite seat was set in a little niche of the
greenery whence he could command all that
went on in his tiny kingdom and, without
moving, could see exactly what Madame la
Femme du Maire was about in the stone-flagged
kitchen.
</p>

<p>
That afternoon an avalanche of three-ton
motor lorries had descended upon the village,
weird vehicles which announced in blatant
language the superiority over all others of
Mayflower's margarine or the outstanding merits of
Pulltite's corsets.  The men in authority were
obviously, from their uniforms, English officers,
and not travellers for the firms in question.
But, frankly, old Pierre was puzzled.  They
had come from the south, and why did they
not continue their journey?  Two of the officers
were actually proposing to stay with him, for
an indefinite period.
</p>

<p>
M. le boulanger walked slowly across the
road to confer with him about the baking of
more bread.  "But these English are like a
locust swarm, and I have no more flour," he
explained.
</p>

<p>
"A glass of cider for monsieur, Henriette."
</p>

<p>
"I do not understand," Pierre went on,
"what it is ces braves garçons do here.  It is
the third week of war, and by now surely ces
bêtes de Boches should have been driven back
into their own pigsties&mdash;&mdash;  Mais, nom de Dieu,
qu'est ce que c'est?"
</p>

<p>
Down the village street a four-seater car
came lurching from side to side like a drunken
man.  Crash!  It has caught a stone post and
turned over.  In an instant the road is full of
people running.
</p>

<p>
Two men lay dazed as they had been thrown
out.  Both in the yellow-green uniform of the
British, one, certainly, an officer.  Willing
hands lift them tenderly, and someone dashes
a jug of water over their heads.  Then one sees
what has happened.
</p>

<p>
Between the shoulders on the officer's tunic
there is spreading a great dark stain.  Very
carefully they take off the coat and shirt and
try to stanch the blood.  But it is too late;
there is a bullet through the lungs, and, with
a little gasp, the officer lies still.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes the other man recovers
sufficiently to tell how they were taking a
dispatch through to the rear.  The officer was
driving the car when they ran straight into a
patrol of enemy cavalry.  They had got through,
but the enemy opened fire, and now his officer
lies dead.  Things are going badly up there&mdash;and
the man vaguely indicates the country up
north: our men are retiring as hard as they
can; whole regiments are getting wiped out;
and "Gawd knows where the French are."  Can
he get a motor-bike to take on the message?
</p>

<p>
An A.S.C. officer runs for his car, the man
is put in, and off they start again.
</p>

<p>
Only the A.S.C. lorry drivers understood
the story, but the villagers were quick to realise
that something serious was happening.  Old
Pierre remembered 1870, and he knew what
war meant; but to the rest it was a new, hideous
thing, dimly realised, but now, at last, with
this mute witness before them, very real.
</p>

<p>
Then things began to happen.  No one ever
knows how a crowd will spring up in a city
street, apparently by magic, and here suddenly
the village began to fill with men.
</p>

<p>
Four soldiers&mdash;two Scots, a Dorset and a
Bedford man&mdash;black with grime, three days'
growth of beard, hollow-eyed and limping
painfully, appeared in front of Pierre and asked
where they were to go.  A captain of the
Guards, riding a tired farm-horse, with a
colonel walking by his side, one hand on the
horse's flank, came behind, and, tackling the
A.S.C. captain, asked for something to eat.
</p>

<p>
"We've been on the trudge for twelve
hours," said the colonel, "and could get
nothing.  No one knows where anyone is.  The
regiment?  Badly cut up last night and all
scattered, heaven knows where."
</p>

<p>
"Is the mayor about anywhere?"  And a
young Staff officer, with a French interpreter,
pushes his way through the crowd.
</p>

<p>
"A cavalry brigade (or what's left of it"&mdash;he
adds in an undertone) "will be here to-night.
What barns and houses have you available?
How much hay can you get?"
</p>

<p>
Old Pierre is beginning to lose his wits in
the amazing turn of events.
</p>

<p>
"If monsieur will come into the house I
will try to arrange."
</p>

<p>
The officer follows, with a shrug of the
shoulders which might have meant many things.
</p>

<p>
The long summer's day is closing, but there
is no hint of the evening's cool in the heavy air.
All over the little village green, where the
church tower has thrown a grateful shadow, lie
groups of men worn with exhaustion and
sleeping with gulping breaths.  In one corner
Henriette is busy with water and clean linen,
bathing and bandaging horrible, staring wounds.
And the men lie patiently, with now and then
a moan of pain, gazing up at her with the great
round eyes of a hurt collie dog.
</p>

<p>
And now the vanguard of the retiring army
begins to stream in and through&mdash;all arms, all
regiments.  Overhead a flight of aeroplanes
circle, like homing pigeons, seeking where they
may alight.  It is incredible that these are the
regiments which a little ten days ago swung
gaily down the Aldershot roads.
</p>

<p>
At the head of the column there marches a
field battery.  Two days ago the major took it
into action six guns and wagons strong, with
perhaps a couple of hundred men; so proud in
his command, his men, his horses.
</p>

<p>
Now, stand by the path and watch the
battery pass!  And, as it passes, uncover your
head, for it has returned from the very gates of
Death.
</p>

<p>
Two guns&mdash;with three horses each to draw
them.  There are still four drivers left, and
there are still half a dozen gunners.  On the
first limber ride a subaltern and the sergeant-major,
and by the gun walk another sergeant
and the quartermaster-sergeant.  That is the
battery.
</p>

<p>
On the second limber three men sit, swaying
dizzily.  A captain of a cavalry regiment and
two privates of a Scottish regiment.
</p>

<p>
Here marches a battalion of the Guards.
Two days ago it went into action perhaps 1,100
strong.  Uncover your head once again as it
passes, for these men too have looked Death in
the face.
</p>

<p>
At the head there paces slowly an ammunition
mule.  On it, wearing a peasant's slouch
hat, with breeches cut off above the knees, and
with left arm held close by a rough bandage,
there rides the colonel.  Count the men as they
march past in fours: 80, 120, 160, 180, 220.
No, that is the next regiment you are counting
in.  Just 200!  That is the tale of them.
</p>

<p>
Blackened by dust and powder, bearded,
breeches cut short like those of their commanding
officer, the few puttees that are left to
them wrapped round their feet for boots&mdash;otherwise
bits of sacking or cloth, bloody bandages
round heads or arms, some with hats like the
colonel's, most with none at all slowly they
limp by.  And, as they pass, the A.S.C. drivers
silently offer such biscuits or bread as they have.
God, how they wolf the food!
</p>

<p>
The colonel turns round on his "charger,"
and in a hoarse shout:
</p>

<p>
"Battalion!  'Tention!  Pull yourselves
together, lads; a French village!"
</p>

<p>
Ah, the pride of them!  The glory of race
and blood!  This is not the Mons country,
with its blood-soaked memories; 'tis the
Horse Guards Parade, and we're Trooping the
Colour!
</p>

<p>
The click of rifles coming to the slope runs
down the ranks.  The fours line by magic as
the men straighten themselves; it is a new
regiment, marching into action, which the
French villagers see pass before them.
</p>

<p>
"Defeat?  Why, this is part of the joke!
Just to draw the Germans on into the trap."  And
at a word they would have turned to charge
an army corps.
</p>

<p>
And so the regiments pass.  And as the last
of the Division goes through, lights twinkle
from the tiny windows of the cottages and the
great yellow moon climbs slowly over the poplar
trees.  An A.S.C. sergeant mounts a lorry with
a copy of the Paris <i>Daily Mail</i> in his hand, and
entertains an ever-growing audience with the
news that the Russians have invaded Germany
and are marching on Berlin.
</p>

<p>
"It will be all over by Christmas&mdash;but I'd
'ave liked just one slap at them Germans, so
as I could tell the missis," says a late bus-driver.
</p>

<p>
But on the outskirts of the crowd the Staff
officer is talking to the A.S.C. captain:
</p>

<p>
"I've no orders for you, but you've
evidently been forgotten.  You ought to have
had your park fifteen miles farther south by
now.  Things are bad, and there will be the hell
of a scrap round here to-morrow morning.  I
should clear out if I were you."
</p>

<p>
Away up to the north there is a blinding
electric glare coming fast down the road.
Nearer, and it is the headlight on the first of a
long train of R.F.C. light motor-lorries,
slipping silently down on rubber tires.  The dust
rises in clouds above and about them.  Half-way
through the village a motor-cyclist rides,
meeting them.  The dust takes his shadow, and
as he approaches the headlight the silhouette
rises higher and higher until it mounts to the
sky and disappears.  Just as when children play
a shadow pantomime and vanish by jumping
over the lamp.
</p>

<p>
The lorries pass, and the dust slowly settles
once more.  The little lights twinkle clearly
again, and the moon now floods the countryside
in a sheen of silver.
</p>

<p>
But the A.S.C. captain talks earnestly with
his sergeant-major and M. le maire.
</p>

<p>
"We must move, but how can we possibly
carry all those wounded and stragglers?"
</p>

<p>
M. le maire is of opinion that as <i>les Boches</i>
are being driven back into Germany, the
wounded might well remain until ambulances
can be got.
</p>

<p>
The O.C. looks at his sergeant-major.  They
have both guessed the meaning of that retirement,
and they guess also something that they
dare not tell the mayor.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes suffice to rouse all the
men and to get the wounded made as comfortable
as possible in the lorries.  Lights are
switched on the cars, and within half an hour
the column is clear of the village on its way
south.
</p>

<p>
An hour later the advance patrols of a
German cavalry division ride in from the
north; and old Pierre finds that the hay he
had collected for <i>les anglais</i> does not go very
far with his new visitors.
</p>

<p>
Poor old Pierre, and Madame the mayoress,
and the pretty little rose-garden!
</p>

<p>
Such is a little pen-picture, not one whit
exaggerated, of an evening of the Retreat.
And perhaps those few lines will serve to
convey some trifling idea of the wonder of the
achievement.
</p>

<p>
Everywhere regiments and units forgotten,
or lost, or acting on their own initiative.  And
yet, somehow or other, making a composite
whole to turn and repel the attacking hordes.
Staff work practically ceased to exist, and yet
the threads of communication held fast, though
only by a little.
</p>

<p>
Now you have had a glimpse of the men
who, the very next day, fought <i>and won</i> perhaps
the most glorious fight a British Army has
ever shared in.

<p>
The night attack which the First Corps had
so magnificently repulsed was but the prelude
to the greater attack of August 26th.  So
imminent did the danger appear to the
Commander-in-chief, so tense was the anxiety,
that immediately after the firing had died away
at midnight orders were issued to the First
Corps to march again at daybreak.  I cannot
attempt to dwell upon the condition of the men
after the battle of Sunday, the fighting and
marching of Monday and Tuesday, and, finally,
the great fight of Tuesday night.  One can but
quote the words of Sir John French: "They
were too exhausted to be placed in the fighting
line," and "were at the moment incapable
of movement," and so leave the rest to the
imagination.
</p>

<p>
To that extent, then, had von Kluck
succeeded in his scheme.  The First Corps
were temporarily out of action; the French, as
the Commander-in-Chief remarks, "were unable
to afford any support on the most critical
day of all"; and to the Second Corps was left
the task of withstanding the whole German
attack, designed to outflank them on the left
and roll them up.  And the odds against them
were, as at Agincourt, "five to one"; in guns,
more than six to one.
</p>

<p>
Apart from his 3rd and 5th Divisions,
General Smith-Dorrien had taken under his
command the detached 19th Infantry Brigade
(composed of the 2nd Royal Welsh Fusiliers,
1st Scottish Rifles, 1st Middlesex, 2nd Argyll
and Sutherland Highlanders), the infantry and
some of the R.F.A. of the 4th Division, and
two brigades of cavalry, out by Cambrai.
</p>

<p>
The line of the Second Corps on the
Tuesday night extended, roughly, from Le Cateau
on the east to a little south of Cambrai on the
west, or a front of about fifteen miles.  Trenches
had been hastily dug since the previous afternoon.
East of Le Cateau was a big gap between
the two Corps.  This could not be bridged
owing to the exhausted condition of the
regiments in the 2nd Division.
</p>

<p>
Some hours before battle was joined General
Smith-Dorrien realised that it was absolutely
impossible for him to carry out the
Commander-in-Chief's instructions and continue his
retirement in conjunction with the First Corps.
A retirement in face of such overwhelming
numbers would have meant annihilation.  At
2 A.M. he decided to fight, and reported so to
his Chief.  Sir John French replied that the
retirement must continue.
</p>

<p>
"My only chance," rejoined the General,
"is to do my utmost in weakening the
enemy's attack, and then seize such a moment
as I can to retire."
</p>

<p>
General Smith-Dorrien was on the field of
action; Sir John French was at G.H.Q., some
twenty miles to the south.  The man on the
spot, realising that the only hope of stopping the
enemy lay in a successful action, proceeded with
his plans of battle.  The fight began at daylight.
</p>

<p>
About 7 A.M. General Smith-Dorrien
informed G.H.Q. by telephone that the battle
was in progress, and that he was confident
that he could deal the enemy a smashing blow
sufficiently heavy to gain time to withdraw his
weary troops.
</p>

<p>
"General," said the senior Staff officer
over the telephone, "yours is the cheeriest
voice I've heard for three days.  I'll go and
tell the Chief."
</p>

<p>
The Commander-in-Chief, who did not approve
of the decision to fight, in reply instructed
him "to use his utmost endeavours to break off
the action and retire at the earliest possible
moment."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Le Cateau, after which this battle has come
to be named, is a pleasant enough little town
set in a country-side not unlike the Sussex
uplands between Tonbridge and Hastings&mdash;broad,
open pasture- and meadow-land, cut by
tiny valleys, rolling away south to the dip of
St. Quentin.  Through the town runs one
broad street, and here, in the town hall offices,
G.H.Q. had its habitation for a short spell
earlier in the week.  Opposite there was a little
bun-shop and cafè combined, which proudly
announced: "English five o'clock tea."  The
two buxom ladies who dispensed the refreshing
beverage must have overheard many a little
confidence exchanged between their unsuspecting
officer clients, and we heard later that one
of the two had been shot as a German spy.
</p>

<p>
With the earliest dawn the firing began
along the front with such a curious spitefulness
(if one could so call it) that many of our men
afterwards remarked about it.  There were
evidently to be no half measures about this
attack, for the German infantry came on almost
with the first rounds from their guns, advancing
in their usual masses and making big play with
their machine-guns.  It was good country for
this kind of work, while the cover our men got
was generally only such as they could make for
themselves by digging.
</p>

<p>
The morning came on radiantly sunny, with
the sky a lovely pale limpid blue, washed clear
by the downpour of the previous night.
</p>

<p>
"'An' 'tis a foine morning they'll be having
in Lismore for the fair this day," remarked a
lad from County Cork; "but I would not be
missin' the fair <i>we'll</i> be having for all the porter
in Daddy Breean's ould tent.  Ah, will ye look
at that now!  Shure, 'tis the bhoys are coming
early for the knocks they'll be getting.  Will I
be seeing how the little gun is shooting this
morning, yer honour?"
</p>

<p>
The platoon commander nodded, for Jerry
was a privileged favourite.  He was also a
remarkably fine shot.
</p>

<p>
So Jerry nestled his cheek cosily down to
his little gun and took a deep breath, while the
two or three near him looked on with interest.
Jerry lifted his head again, for he was an artist
and knew the value of arousing expectation.
</p>

<p>
"And will it be a golden sovereign if I take
the coat-tails of the little ould gentleman with
the spy-glasses?"  This was Jerry's way of
making a bet.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I'll bet you a sovereign you won't
down that officer on the right, and he looks like
the colonel," said the platoon commander.  It
was a 500 yards' shot, and hazy, too.
</p>

<p>
Jerry carefully judged the distance by a
half-way haystack, adjusted his sight, and settled
down once again.  "For the ould counthry!"
he breathed, and slowly squeezed the trigger.
</p>

<p>
The "little ould gentleman" was seen to
clap his hand smartly to his leg, while two men
ran up to him.
</p>

<p>
"Will ye double the stakes, yer honour, for
me to take the three o' them?" said Jerry over
his shoulder, clicking his bolt back and forward
again.
</p>

<p>
"A fiver, Jerry, if you do it."
</p>

<p>
Jerry wedged his rifle between two stones,
took a slightly fuller sight, and almost before
you could have counted them three shots
cracked out.
</p>

<p>
"Have you that fiver on you, yer honour,
or will I be taking an IOU?"  And Jerry
leaned back with a sigh of satisfaction as a
mighty cheer ran down the trench, and the
platoon officer shook him hard by the hand.
What the enemy thought about it one could
only surmise, but a few of the men shook their
fists threateningly in the direction of the British
lines.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Now let us follow for a little the fortunes
of a Brigade in a particularly warm corner of
the line close to a small town where a very
strong German attack soon developed.  The
guns of the Brigade opened fire at daybreak.
They had managed to dig some serviceable
pits, and were as snugly ensconced as time
had allowed.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

GENERAL SIR DOUGLAS HAIG.
</p>

<p>
For an hour, perhaps, the German guns
pounded steadily away without making very
much impression; and our R.F.A. as steadily
replied.  Many of the outlying farms and
houses were badly knocked about and began to
burn fiercely.  About 7.30 the enemy made a
determined attempt to get hold of a flank
position for their machine-guns to enfilade our
infantry; and it was then that one regiment
lost horribly before our cavalry could get
round in a counter-attack.  So heavy were
their casualties that, as a regiment, they were
simply out of action, and an urgent message
was dispatched to the next Brigade for anything
they could possibly send in the way of
reinforcements.  Badly off though they were, two
battalions were promptly transferred.  Just one
more instance of working shoulder to shoulder.
</p>

<p>
It was curious how certain regiments
suffered very heavily while other units next to
them got off comparatively lightly.  One
R.F.A. brigade, for instance, was right in
the thick of the fighting from Mons to the
Aisne, and yet had very few losses until the
middle of September, while the battery next
on their left on this Wednesday suffered
very badly.  Of two other batteries I came
across, one was in action right through to the
Aisne, and did not have a single casualty, while
a second (most curious of all), in the First
Corps, never fired a shot until the big advance
of the Corps at the Aisne on September 14th.
</p>

<p>
About 9 A.M. things began to look serious.
Several enemy infantry attacks had been met
by desperate counter-charges; but numbers
were bound to tell.  A German cavalry
regiment had succeeded in working round to the
flank, and now they made a gallant effort to
capture the British guns.
</p>

<p>
This was, I believe, one of the very few
occasions when the enemy cavalry had a real
chance of getting any of our batteries by a
charge.  There was a clear field, and they had
got to within 500 yards of the battery, when
the guns opened on them.  Our men had heard
about the fatal charge of the 9th Lancers, and
now it was their turn.  The battery commander
dropped to "fuse o, open sights," and the
detachments worked as though the devil were
behind them.  In the next 250 yards the cavalry
lost a good two-thirds of the regiment, and
they got no nearer than 200 yards from the
guns.  A British squadron luckily came out at
the moment, and charged clean through the
remnant, wheeled, and cut up what still
remained.  And that was the end of that very
game attack.
</p>

<p>
If only the Germans would always play fair,
there would be nothing to grumble about.
Their infantry cannot, of course, be compared
with the British, and our cavalry have always
come out better than theirs in a clean fight; but
the Germans have always fought courageously
when it was a case of genuine fighting.  Indeed,
it is a very poor compliment to our men to
suggest otherwise.
</p>

<p>
But the main attack, instead of being
checked, seemed to gather strength, until it
became manifestly impossible to protect and
hold the little town any longer.  The infantry
accordingly gradually withdrew under cover of
the guns, and at last the guns were limbered
up and marched back to another position
farther south, the Brigade having held the
corner for something like four hours.
</p>

<p>
Most of the townsfolk had begun their flight
late on the previous evening, but a good many
still remained.  Had they only known the fate
in store for them, the invaders would have
found an empty town.  But, at least in this
case, vengeance was swift, as you shall hear.
</p>

<p>
The Brigade, then, took up its new position,
and the men were able to make themselves
fairly snug before the enemy had finished with
the town.  Fortunately, too, many of our
wounded were got away from the hospital, for
the Germans had begun to shell that some time
before.  But it was a very trying business, as
there were not enough ambulances for the very
large number of casualties, and many had to be
carried on the already overloaded regimental
transport.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Now, it must be remembered that General
Smith-Dorrien had absolutely no reserves on
which to draw if any part of his line began to
bend back.  The usual plan is, of course, to
keep certain fresh regiments concentrated at
given spots to move up in support as and when
required.  But now, if the Inniskillings were
getting badly cut up and a gap was being made,
the G.O.C. could only call upon the Cheshires,
say, a mile off, who were not being so strongly
attacked, to send a company or so to the help
of their comrades.
</p>

<p>
Another thing.  I have hinted in a previous
chapter that the threads of communication with
the ammunition supply were badly stretched to
breaking-point, owing to the astonishing speed
at which the British had to retire.  Normally,
the ammunition parks (motor transport) draw
the ammunition supplies from railhead, and
carry it up to the divisional ammunition
columns.  These, in turn, distribute to brigade
columns, and the actual units draw upon the
last named.  Thus there are several links
between railhead and the firing-line, and the
motor-lorries should not come within about
eight miles of the line.
</p>

<p>
But on this Wednesday and the two or
three following days all this arrangement literally
went to pieces.  How could it be otherwise?
And that is how the A.S.C. drivers came to
do their bit with all the rest.  Speed was vital,
and the lorries could cover the distance in a
third of the time taken by the horse transport.
In fact, the horse transport was ignored or
forgotten, although there were exceptions.  One
saw the divisional columns aimlessly trekking
about the country, at one moment under orders
to go to a certain village, only to find on arrival
that the enemy were just a mile off; back they
would come again as hard as the tired horses
could do it.
</p>

<p>
Time and again an urgent message would
go back from a battery for more 18-pr. or
howitzer, and the dispatch-rider would have
instructions to get the stuff wherever he could
lay hands on it.  He generally managed to find
a few lorries of a "park," and so off the bus
drivers would start with their three-ton vehicles,
little dreaming that they were going under fire.
</p>

<p>
"Gor blimey, sir," said one of them next
day to his officer, "I tell yer it wos a fair
beano!  We'd gone abaht a couple o' miles,
when the sergeant wot wos along o' me on the
box 'e sez: 'Stevens,' sez 'e, 'can yer knock
anything more aht of 'er?  'Cos they're firing
acrost the road.'  Lor lumme, I nearly put 'er
in the ditch at the turn 'e giv me!  Yer see,
sir, I didn't enlist to get knocked aht by no
b&mdash;&mdash; German.  I'm a peaceable man, I am,
wot likes my grub and pint o' bitter reg'lar
like, and the missus the same.  But, as I wos
a-sayin', I turned to the sergeant an' I sez:
'Yer don't fink there's no danger, do yer?'  An'
the sergeant, 'e sez, sarkastic-like: 'Ho
no, they're only bustin' the shells on the road,
an' we've got a few tons of fireworks be'ind
wot's bahnd to bust too if we gits 'it!'  S'welp
me pink, sir, I turned that cold you could 'ave
'eard my teeth going louder nor the enjin.
</p>

<p>
"'E 'adn't 'ardly spoke when there was the
'ell of a bang somewheres just be'ind, and&mdash;well,
you can bet your life, sir, we did a guy
for all we wos worth.  Lord, 'ow we 'opped it
dahn that road!  I tell yer, sir, we knocked
forty-five miles an hour aht o' that ole bus, and
she come up to it like as we wos knockin' spots
orf of a pirit bus dahn Piccadilly.
</p>

<p>
"The sergeant, 'e jammed 'is 'eel dahn on
the accelerator, an' I just 'eld on to the wheel
wiv bofe 'ands.  It wos a fair old Brock's
benifit we wos in.  But we got frew orl right,
and wen we got to the place where we wos to
drop the stuff, there weren't no guns wot
wanted it.  An', as old G. R. Sims sez, 'hit
wos the unkindest cut of orl.'  Well, I wasn't
coming back agin frew that pyrriteknikle show
not for the ole bus full o' suvrins, an' so we
come 'ome rahnd by a place I forgit the name
of, and that's 'ow we're late; but it was worf
the hextra thirty miles rahnd, an' I 'ope, sir,
yer won't mind this time."
</p>

<p>
There was another occasion on this day
when three of these lorries went forward under
the charge of an officer.  He was quite unaware
that the village whence the call for howitzer
shell had come had been captured by the
Germans half an hour after the message had been
sent.  On the way he picked up another officer
who was lost.
</p>

<p>
Rounding a corner by a wood, about a mile
from the village, they came straight upon a
small German cavalry outpost.  The Germans
sprang to their feet at the rumble of the
approaching lorries, and a sergeant stood in
the road to bar the way.
</p>

<p>
There was not a moment for thought, and
the second officer whipped his pistol out and
took a snap shot.  Luckily, he killed the
sergeant outright.  The officer in charge jumped
down into the road as the lorry pulled up, with
his own revolver in hand, and levelled it at the
group by the roadside.  One of them got his
carbine off from the hip, and the shot just
missed the first lorry driver on his seat.  The
officer promptly sent a bullet through the man's
chest.  Over his shoulder he shouted to the
drivers to reverse the lorries, while he and the
other officer held up the Germans.
</p>

<p>
Now, reversing three big lorries in not too
wide a road needs some doing; but they all
backed and advanced and sidled and backed
until it was done.  Then one officer jumped up
behind the last one, the second officer followed,
and off the lorries went.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing remarkable about the
little experience, and it is only recorded to show
the difficulties in ammunition supply at this
time and also how the A.S.C. drivers were
doing their job.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
You must imagine that while we have been
at the rear with the A.S.C., the fighting all
along the British line has been growing in
intensity.  A big flank attack, with the idea of
rolling up the whole line like a ball of string,
is always a favourite move of the Germans, and
this time they were trying to crush the British
left.
</p>

<p>
But although the left was the main objective,
the enemy still had a big superiority in
numbers for frontal attacks, and these they kept
up without ceasing.  It was just like the crashing
of many mighty hammers from one end to
the other.
</p>

<p>
Following up the policy of making counterattacks
whenever possible, a bold offensive was
made against the little town from which we
had just been driven.  The enemy had now
been in possession for two or three hours.  So
word was passed to the batteries, some of the
indefatigable cavalry was concentrated, and the
infantry, with the two reinforcing battalions,
received the cheering news that they were to
advance.
</p>

<p>
How they all went at it!  Under the
heaviest fire our guns could pour in, the
infantry rushed the outlying houses, the main
street, and the town itself, the cavalry sweeping
up on the flank.  The gunners, after raising the
range to put a curtain before the infantry,
limbered up, and had the satisfaction of
marching back through the town which they had just
been forced to evacuate.
</p>

<p>
Then it was that our men first saw a little
of the hideous work of the invaders upon the
civilian population.  And if anything more
were needed to brace them up to fight to the
last man, they had it in that brief hour in the
recaptured town.
</p>

<p>
The hospital was burning fiercely, just as
that at Mons had done.  Such a building, with
its Red Cross flag, was always a convenient
ranging point for the enemy.  In it there had
been some 400 wounded and other casualties.  A
large number of these had been got away, but
a number had, perforce, to be left.  Their end
must have been too cruel to dwell upon.
</p>

<p>
Up the main street everywhere was horrible
evidence that <i>they</i> had been at work.  Mingled
with dead or wounded combatants were bodies
of women and children, many terribly mutilated,
while other women knelt beside them, with
stone-set faces or gasping through hysterical
weeping.  From behind shutters or half-closed
doors others looked out, blinded with terror.
</p>

<p>
But there was one thing which, for the men
who saw it, dwarfed all else.  Hanging up in
the open window of a shop, strung from a hook
in the cross-beam, like a joint in a butcher's
shop, was the body of a little girl, five years
old, perhaps.  Its poor little hands had been
hacked off, and through the slender body were
vicious bayonet stabs.
</p>

<p>
Yes, close your eyes in horror, but it is right
that our people should hear and know these
things.  There must be no false, vapid sentiment
in refusing to think about them.  There
should not be a home in the British Empire
where the facts of German atrocities are not
known, and where, in realising them, hearts are
not nerved to yield their last drop of blood in
stamping out from the world of men the hideous
Thing which has done them.
</p>

<p>
After that the Brigade "saw red."  There
was no more talk of taking prisoners, and if
there was another ounce they could put into
their work they did it.  The sight of those
poor distracted women kneeling down in the
road before our men, or hanging round their
knees praying to be taken away, would have
melted the stoniest hearts.  The situation was
serious enough, for another German attack in
force was bound to follow, and the Brigade
had little hope of getting away safely
themselves.  But they could not possibly leave the
women behind again&mdash;nor did they.  Somehow
or other they escorted, on guns, limbers and
vehicles, all they could find safely on to the
southward road, sullenly retiring once more
before the new counter-attack.

CHAPTER XII
<br />
WEDNESDAY, THE 26TH OF AUGUST
<br />
(<i>continued</i>)
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  <i>A many of our bodies shall, no doubt<br />
  Find native graves; upon the which, I trust,<br />
  Shall witness live in brass of this day's work;<br />
  And those that leave their valiant bones in France,<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
By midday the tide of battle had begun to roll
southwards, though only by a very little.  The
British lines were forced back, a mile here, half
a mile there, but they still held on with
superhuman energy and determination.  And not
only did they hold on, but, wherever there was
the least chance, a regiment or cavalry squadron
would launch a counter-attack.  But it all
seemed so hopeless, just as one might throw
pebbles into the waves of the sea as they break
upon a beach.
</p>

<p>
Some day it is to be hoped that an adequate
record will be published of the remarkable work
which the cavalry performed during the Retreat.
Sir John French, perhaps because he was
himself a cavalry leader, hardly mentions them in
his first dispatch.  Wherever they were most
wanted, there they were in the thick of the
fighting.  How the horses "carried on" and
where and how fresh animals were obtained
remains a mystery, in view of the muddle in
which everything was.
</p>

<p>
But where every unit and every man worked
as they did, it seems almost invidious to single
out for mention any particular regiment or
episode.  Take a single half-hour of the fighting
on the left, and you have an example of what
was repeated fifty times that day across the
whole British front.
</p>

<p>
A blue-grey mass of enemy infantry appears
advancing with steady, swinging pace.  At 500
yards or a trifle more one of our regiments opens
rapid fire upon them.  You can actually see the
lanes in the German ranks ploughed through by
the British rifle-fire.  Still they advance, for the
gaps are filled almost immediately.  Nearer and
nearer, until that regiment which began the
advance has almost ceased to exist.  The
remnant breaks and scatters in confusion, and as
they break away another new regiment is
disclosed behind them.  Such is the method of the
German massed attack, overwhelming by sheer
numbers.
</p>

<p>
But rarely did they get near enough to the
British lines for a hand-to-hand fight.
Regiment after regiment would be held at bay by
the murderous rifle-fire of the little handful of
British; regiment after regiment would appear
to fill the gap.  Now and again the weight of
the attack would tell, and the Germans would
get close enough for a final rush on the British
trench.  Then, at the critical moment, a British
company, slightly forward on the flank, pours
in a withering enfilade fire, and while the
German infantry stagger under this unexpected
attack the British cavalry charge through our
own lines straight on the front and flank of
the enemy.  There are a few minutes of mad
cut and thrust, and the Germans, who always
dread the cold steel as a Chinese dreads rain,
break and run as though all the fiends of hell
were after them.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Just about this time General Smith-Dorrien
and a couple of his Staff officers were following
the fortunes of the battle from some rising
ground not far from the centre of the line.  A
sudden outburst of heavy and incessant firing
was heard from the direction of Cambrai, where,
it will be remembered, the enemy were trying
to outflank us.
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens," cried the General, "the
Germans have got round our left!"  And,
jumping on to his horse, he galloped off towards
the firing.
</p>

<p>
To his astonishment and delight he found,
as he drew near the flank, that the firing came
not from victorious Germans, but from some
of our French comrades.
</p>

<p>
Never was help more opportune; seldom
can it have come in more dramatic fashion.  By
all accounts General Sordêt with his cavalry
should have been sitting by the roadside, forty
miles away on the British right, tending his
worn-out horses.  Yet, at the call for help, by
sheer grit and determination he and his Corps
had carried through that long forced march
(Heaven knows how the horses did it!), and
swept up on our left with his squadrons and
horse artillery.  Everyone knows what splendid
work the French gunners can do, and&mdash;well,
this was one of their best days.
</p>

<p>
It was a thrilling episode, and why, in
common justice to our gallant Allies, the details
have not been published I do not know.  You
will find General Smith-Dorrien's record and
appreciation of the invaluable help thus given
by General Sordêt in the second Appendix at
the end of the book.
</p>

<p>
While such were the conditions about
midday up with the front line, the situation
immediately in the rear was fast becoming
indescribable in its confusion and complexity.
Looking back at it now, after the lapse of
so many months, it seemed very much like a
theatrical performance where a "front cloth"
has been lowered to conceal from the audience
a strike of stage hands and the despair of the
actors at setting the stage and getting on with
the play.  Before the front cloth a special
"turn" is performing to gain time and appease
the growing impatience of the audience.
</p>

<p>
There was, for instance, a particular centre
of cross-roads, nearly a mile beyond where
German shells were bursting.  It was just outside
a large village, and the inhabitants were
streaming out with their belongings, yet uncertain
whether there was actual danger or no.
</p>

<p>
At the cross-roads were gradually arriving
ammunition columns, remnants of battered
regiments, motor-lorries, and odd cavalry
patrols; and no one had the vaguest idea as
to why they were there nor where they were to
go next.  A Staff officer standing there was as
much at sea as the rest.  Every moment more
and more transport would roll up, and more and
more stragglers, while hanging on to the
outskirts of the crowd were increasing numbers of
frightened women and children.  An old curé
alone seemed calm and collected.  Over another
village a little way back down the road the
German shells come bursting ever nearer.  It
must be remembered that even the Staff had
but a hazy idea of the trend of events, and that
outside the Staff not a soul had any notion of
what was really happening to the Force.  It
was just a matter of doing your own special
bit.
</p>

<p>
Right into this confused mass came running
some R..A.M.C. orderlies.  "The Germans are
just behind!" they shouted.  There might have
been a bad panic with all those civilians about,
but there was only rather more confusion.  The
Staff officer gave a general order to retire on
St. Quentin (a large town about seven miles to
the south); and then there was one mad rush.
</p>

<p>
Motor-lorries blocked the whole road, trying
to reverse, while wounded and stragglers
made a dash for the nearest vehicles.
Ammunition columns struck off the road on to the
open down-land.  The refugees streamed
straight across country.  Down the road the
heavy lorries went pounding, and soon
outdistanced everyone else.  At one corner there
were two R.F.A. drivers in charge of five heavy
draught horses.  "Germans be'ind us," yelled
a lorry driver; "better move!"  And they did
move.  The sight of those old "hairies" clopping
down the road at a hand gallop after the
disappearing lorries was too ludicrous for words.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
By 3 P.M. the weight of the enemy's attack
had begun to tell, and, to quote the
Commander-in-Chief's dispatch, "it became
apparent that, if complete annihilation was to be
avoided, a retirement must be attempted; and
the order was given to commence it about
3.30 P.M."
</p>

<p>
Now came the most critical time of all.
At the beginning of the day the enemy must
have imagined that a retirement would be made
at the earliest opportunity.  But as the hours
passed, and the British line still held, the
impression may have spread that they intended
to fight the day to a finish where they stood.
Certainly it is impossible to think that had they
realised a definite retirement to be in progress,
they would not have thrown every man they had
upon the rear of the Corps.
</p>

<p>
Slowly and cautiously, then, regiment after
regiment fell back.  I have tried to show in an
earlier chapter what that means and how much
depends upon the guns at such a juncture.
Again I can only quote the Commander-in-Chief's
words: "The movement was covered
with the most devoted intrepidity and
determination by the artillery, which had itself
suffered severely."
</p>

<p>
I will just give one instance of what that
devotion meant, a devotion which, as has
everywhere been agreed, saved the situation.
</p>

<p>
Close under a ridge a battery had been in
action without a moment's rest for the last six
hours.  One gun after another had been knocked
out, the battery commander and every officer
save one killed, all the men of the detachments
killed or wounded, until there was left just one
gun, one subaltern, and one driver.  And still
they kept the battery in action; still they loaded
and fired, as they had been doing all through
that ghastly day.
</p>

<p>
"Got a drink?" said the subaltern; "a
cigarette?  Good!  Thank God for a white
man's cigarette again!"  And he went on with
his job.  That was what "covering the
movement" meant.
</p>

<p>
But the battle had been won.  General
Smith-Dorrien, his officers and men, had
accomplished the almost superhuman task thrust upon
them.  They had not merely held the German
attack through all the long hours of that blazing
August day; they had <i>broken</i> it.  For the
remainder of the Retreat it never recovered its
sting and energy, and so the Force and Paris
were saved.
</p>

<p>
Events have had time to shape themselves
during the months that have lapsed since
August, 1914, and it is possible to view them
in a certain perspective.  It has been urged that
we British have exaggerated the importance of
the work of the Force in the Retreat; that while
we were holding a line of no more than 20 odd
miles, the French were extended over a front
of 400 miles against an equally strong attack;
that, by the prominence given to the work of
the Force to the neglect of that of the French,
a distorted picture has been given of the
operations during August from Alsace to the
sea.
</p>

<p>
To these arguments I would reply that
Germany was staking everything upon that
rush to Paris.  For years past we had known
that her intentions were to bring France to her
knees within the first month or so, to admit of
turning to meet Russia before that country had
fully mobilised.  And so, with this definite task
in view, Germany concentrated her main attack
through Belgium and south by Mons.  She had
not only her greatest strength in the armies of
von Kluck and von Buelow, but she included in
these masses of troops the flower of the German
Army, picked regiments like the Prussian
Guard, the "Iron" 3rd Corps of Brandenburg,[<a id="chap12fn1text"></a><a href="#chap12fn1">1</a>]
and others.  Add to these facts the
sustained violence of the invasion, and the
concentrated hate which was levelled against
Belgians and British by the invaders when the
attack was continually and successfully checked,
and I think that there is sufficient evidence to
indicate the vital importance of the work of the
British Force.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, the French people themselves
had, with fine generosity, recognised that it
was the British Force, under God's hand, which
had saved Paris: for on Sunday, August 30th,
prayers of thanksgiving were offered up in the
churches on behalf of our troops.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And now, hopelessly inadequate as this
record has so far been, words utterly fail me in
attempting to describe the events of the next
twelve hours, and how the Retreat was
continued.  It was one long, ghastly nightmare.
</p>

<p>
As regiment after regiment received its
orders to retire, the survivors staggered to their
feet, blinded by the ordeal of the day, and
crept back until they reached a point where
ranks could be formed.  Then they got moving.
Their destination no one knew, no one cared....
Keep moving!  Men licked their blackened
lips with parched tongues.  "Any chance of a
drink?"  "Not here; perhaps we shall pass a
village."  Keep moving!  "Got a fag on
you?"  "Smoked the last this morning; perhaps get
some in the village."  "Where the b&mdash;&mdash; 'ell
is your village?"  "Gawd knows." ... Keep
moving!
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes later.  "Where the 'ell are we
going? and why the &mdash;&mdash; are we retreating?
Give 'em socks, didn't we?  And where the &mdash;&mdash;
are them &mdash;&mdash; Frenchies?"   "Oh, shut yer 'ed,
carn't yer?" ... Keep moving!
</p>

<p>
There was a tiny village called Estrées in a
hollow of the downs about three miles out from
St. Quentin.  Here at 4 P.M. the confusion was
indescribable.  Lorries, stragglers, refugees,
transport columns, guns&mdash;all inextricably mixed
up.  It was, I believe, supposed to be a bivouac
point for the night, but no one knew definitely.
In any case, they were all tightly wedged in
that hollow, and the Germans were but a very
few miles behind.  Had an enemy battery come
within range, as it might well have done, it
would have meant certain death for every soul
there.  Later in the evening news got to
G.H.Q. of the position, and rations were sent
up to the starving troops, with definite orders
about further retirement.
</p>

<p>
Staff work simply went to pieces.  It was
not that men lost their heads or anything like
that, but the various H.Q.'s found it impossible
to keep pace with events.  A regiment would
be in a certain position, then it would be
completely forgotten (or so it seemed), and no
orders would arrive to move.  Many C.O.'s
retired entirely on their own initiative, and so
got clear.  Others decided to await instructions,
and so got wiped out or captured.
</p>

<p>
As dusk gathered into darkness the confusion
grew worse, while discomfort increased
(if possible) with the steady downpour of ram
which followed.  But there was no moment's
rest for the exhausted troops, save when a
regiment came up against an obstacle across the
road&mdash;a broken-down motor-van or gun-wagon.
Then, if there were any sappers handy, the
vehicle would be blown up and the road cleared....
Anyhow, keep moving!
</p>

<p>
And the dreadful agonies of the wounded.
At St. Quentin there was a big hospital which
had been gradually filling during the past
twenty-four hours.  Now, on this afternoon,
G.H.Q. found it advisable to pack up in a
hurry and leave for farther south.  And the
hospital&mdash;would it share the same fate as those
of Mons and Le Cateau?  Once again the
movable cases were hastily got into ambulances
and other conveyances, and carried off in the
wake of G.H.Q.  But for hundreds of men
there was no chance of getting even so far as
St. Quentin for attention.  Through the day
the R.A.M.C. had worked as hard as the
fighters, but it was very little more than first
aid which could be given.  No chance for deft
operation, anti-tetanus serum or the like.
</p>

<p>
So, mingled with the retreating army were
the ghosts of men swathed in bloody bandages,
some clinging to vehicles on which they had
found a seat, others marching with vague,
uncertain pace by the infantry, others, again,
just dropping out, to huddle exhausted by the
roadside waiting for dawn and a fate which now
had no meaning for them.
</p>

<p>
Keep moving! ... Horse after horse in
the slowly trekking columns of batteries or
supply transport dropped down and fouled the
wheels.  Unhook or cut the traces; push the
poor beast out of the road.  An old pal, was
he?  Aye, he was a fine "wheeler," that dark
bay!  Remember the first time we had him in
at practice camp?  Nothing matters now but
keeping on the move.  Yes, better shoot him.
He deserves a clean end.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Dozens, perhaps hundreds of men got cut
adrift from their regiments that day, adrift and
hopelessly lost in a strange country.  No house,
no village was safe as sanctuary, for the tide
of invasion lapped at the threshold and would
presently overwhelm it.  One trivial incident I
heard of seems worthy of record as an instance
of "individuality" in the training of the British
soldier.
</p>

<p>
A man&mdash;-we will call him Headlam&mdash;got
adrift by himself from the 3rd Division out on
the left flank.  After many hours' wandering,
he came to a little farmhouse on the road.
Here the good woman took him in, fed him,
and gave him a shakedown.  There were also
there a couple of French stragglers.
</p>

<p>
A few hours later the little son of the farm
came running in with the news that a patrol of
the dreaded Uhlans was coming down the road.
That meant murder for everyone.  There was
no time to hide, and the French were at
their wits' end.
</p>

<p>
Headlam's first thought was for cover.  Out
in the yard there was a big rain-tub.  Calling
the two French soldiers to help, they rolled it
out longways on into the road, and one of them,
with Headlam, got behind with their rifles.
The moment the patrol appeared, Headlam
gave the Uhlans an excellent example of rapid
fire, and three saddles were empty before they
realised where the attack came from.  Then
they charged.  French and British, side by side,
ground away with their rifles, and when the
Uhlans reached the little fortress there were
only three left out of the patrol of nine.  The
second Frenchman, by the side of the road,
accounted for another, and, with three to two,
the Uhlans surrendered.
</p>

<p>
So our three musketeers found themselves
with five excellent horses and a couple of
prisoners; and I leave you to picture the
triumphal procession which passed through the
villages on the southward journey.  The order
of march was: Jacques and a led horse, Pierre
and a led horse, two disconsolate Uhlans on
foot (and hating it), and Headlam (with female
escort), as G.O.C., bringing up the rear....
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Keep moving! ... But oh, the inexpressible
weariness of it!  No torture is more refined
than that of preventing a worn-out human being
from sleeping; and here it was experienced to
the full.  The picture of the Force that night
might well have created for Dante the vision of
one more circle of Hell.
</p>

<p>
Hunger was long since forgotten, but a
red-hot thirst remained.  One could appreciate
as never before how Dives thirsted when he
asked for Lazarus to touch his lips with a
moistened finger.  On, ever on, for hour after
eternal hour, riding or trudging through the
inky darkness, never a halt....  Keep moving!
</p>

<p>
How the troops did it I cannot tell.  It
was not the triumph of will over the exhausted
body, for the sense of volition had fled, and men
were mere automata in their movements.  The
legs jerked forwards as those of a clockwork toy.
Had the men halted they could never have got
moving again; the clockwork would have run down.
</p>

<p>
In the saddle it was little better.  Every
muscle of the body ached with an intolerable
dull throbbing; a deadly coma crept through
the brain and dragged at the eyelids.  Nerveless
fingers clutched at the pommel of the saddle,
and were pulled away by the drag of the heavy
arms.
</p>

<p>
One knows how a single night of sleeplessness
will tell its tale in the face of a man or
woman.  Here was the fourth night of ceaseless
fighting and marching, with only an odd hour
of rest now and again.
</p>

<p>
All through the night and on into the daylight
hours sounded the plod-plod of marching
men, the grumble&mdash;creak&mdash;grumble of transport
or guns.  And in the far rear of the moving
columns were more regiments lined out, showing
a bold front to the still advancing enemy,
ever guarding the backs of their comrades so
far as was humanly possible.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
One particularly sad disaster befell a
regiment in the course of the retirement; it is
remarkable that there were not many others of
a like nature.  The 1st Gordons lost their way
after dark, and began to march in a direction
across the front of the German advance.  About
midnight the regiment found itself moving into
masses of troops.  The first thought was that
they were amongst the French, for it was
supposed that they had been marching towards
French support.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly fire was opened upon the regiment
from all sides, and though the Gordons put up
the gallant fight which they have ever done in
a tight corner, the odds were too impossible,
and ten minutes saw the end.
</p>

<p>
I think that disaster affected the Force more
than anything else in that opening month.
Men spoke of it in hushed tones.  A magnificent
regiment with glorious traditions, and to
be crushed out as they were in those few
minutes.  And yet not crushed out!  Though
the older generation of the family may die,
there is the younger generation which follows,
and their sons after them.  And well do I
remember that younger generation at the Aisne,
when the Regiment rose again reincarnate from
the ashes of the dead.  I see now the stern-set
faces of the officers, proud in their determination
to avenge their honour; faces shaded and
hallowed by the knowledge of what the Regiment
had done and suffered, what it must now
do and suffer that their dead may rest in peace.
As it was, so shall it be,
</p>

CHAPTER XIII
<br />
THE RETREAT CONTINUES
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  <i>We are but warriors for the working-day;<br />
  Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd<br />
  With rainy marching in the painful field;<br />
  There's not a piece of feather in our host,<br />
<span style="letter-spacing: 4em">*****</span><br />
  And time hath worn us into slovenry;<br />
  But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The following days saw no rest for the exhausted
troops, and they were compelled to plod on ever
farther and farther south.  If the rapidity of the
German advance was so astonishing, even more
so was the speed at which the British retired
before them.  For it is a hundred times more
easy to do the advancing than the retiring.  In
the former case there is the confidence of
success, with the feeling that at any moment
the coveted prize may be snapped up.  In the
latter there is the inevitable feeling that things
are going wrong, that the army is suffering
defeat, and the constant dread that the troops
may not stand the tremendous strain upon their
powers of endurance.
</p>

<p>
So it was that every encouragement was
given to the rumour which ran through the
Force that this was but a strategical retirement,
part of the plan decided on years before between
the French and British Headquarters Staffs.
And the idea of the Retreat was that the British
were to draw the Germans ever southward,
while the Belgian forces were gradually closing
in behind the invaders on the west, and the
French doing the same on the east.  Then at
the psychological moment the signal would be
flashed round, the British would suddenly turn
and present a dead wall, the strings of the net
would be pulled tight, and&mdash;hey presto! we
should all be home by Christmas.
</p>

<p>
There was only one part of the scheme which
everyone regretted, and that was that we should
be out of the entry into Berlin.  It is all very
well to keep up your wicket while the other
fellow makes the runs, but then the other fellow
gets all the credit.  You see, everybody knew
for a fact that the Russians were only a couple
of days from the German capital, and that
heartened the Force almost more than anything
else.  However, one consoled the men by telling
them that regiments were sure to be picked by
ballot to represent the British in the march
through; and as for the newspaper prizes to the
first man or regiment in&mdash;well, that regiment
would surely be sporting and share the prize.
</p>

<p>
How many times one must have explained
this wonderful piece of strategy to the good
French folk I should not like to guess.  On
passing through a little village, generally at
dusk, one of the things one always had to do,
after dispelling the fears of the ancient
policeman who tried to hold up the battery with an
antiquated fowling-piece, was to draw maps on
the sanded floor of the café for the edification
of the local magnates.
</p>

<p>
"Why do we thus retire, madame?  But
it is so simple.  It is a piece of strategy of
the most clever.  The Allemands"&mdash;here the
audience spit profusely&mdash;"come thus, the
Belgians are here, etc.  etc.  At any moment
we turn to attack, etc.  How many English,
madame?  Ah, madame, it is not permitted to
tell; but for your ear, madame (and I would
tell no one else), they say that the second
quarter of a million disembarked yesterday."
</p>

<p>
Perhaps our kindly hosts will by now have
forgiven us, but at least much of it we believed
ourselves at the time.  It all helped to keep the
men going and prevent sudden panic with the
countryfolk.  It is difficult to say whether we
did wrong.
</p>

<p>
By 8 A.M. on the Thursday the retiring
columns were well on their way beyond
St. Quentin.  The First Corps, during the eventful
Wednesday, had also been steadily retiring,
and had had comparatively little fighting
to do.  The condition of the troops will be
remembered.
</p>

<p>
About half an hour later the rear-guard
reached St. Quentin.  The batteries marched in,
watered their horses in the square, and marched
out again immediately, the infantry covering
them outside the town.
</p>

<p>
It was a little curious in St. Quentin&mdash;the
attitude of the inhabitants.  No one seemed
to take any interest in the British movements,
and certainly no one appeared to bother
himself one atom about the German approach.
St. Quentin is a big garrison town, with fine
open places and streets, excellent shops and
stately buildings, and the wealth of the place
must be great.  Yet there was never a hint of
an exodus, and the people accepted the whole
situation with astonishing sang-froid.  I believe
that when the Germans did arrive, a little later
in the day, they surrounded the town and
marched in from all sides at once, to find
their triumphant entry opposed by&mdash;one British
soldier.  This man had got lost or left behind
in a house, and now turned out with his rifle
to defend the town.  The German division had
to open fire with a machine-gun upon the gallant
lad before he fell, face to the enemy, riddled
with bullets.  The war can have witnessed few
more remarkable episodes.
</p>

<p>
The fact that the R.F.A. with the rearguard
were able to continue their retirement
throughout the day without having to fire a
round will show how well the Second Corps
had smashed the German attack.
</p>

<p>
It should also be recorded that on this
Thursday and Friday the Force had further
help from the French.  General Sordêt's cavalry
continued its excellent work in relieving the
pressure on the left of the Second Corps.
</p>

<p>
G.H.Q. had moved from St. Quentin on
the Wednesday afternoon, and taken up their
abode at Noyon, a cathedral town about 30 miles
farther south.  Here, again, no one seemed to
have the slightest inkling of impending danger,
and the business of the town was being carried
on as usual.  The mayor certainly posted a
proclamation imploring the "citoyens" to
remain calm and to pay no heed to rumours,
and the citoyens obeyed by wondering why
M. le maire should have so put himself about
as to issue such a notice.
</p>

<p>
That was on the Thursday.  But on the
Friday the citoyens received something of a
shock.  A number of British regiments marched
through in broad daylight, and it was now
plainly to be seen that something very serious
was happening.  After the first gasp of
astonishment and utter incredulity, the people
stood by the road in dead silence with tears of
pity running down their cheeks.  So long as I
live I can never forget that scene, the intense
drama of it, the tragedy, and the glory of
achievement which shone radiantly forth.
</p>

<p>
The remnants of three gallant regiments we
watched go by, and we could look no longer.
There is no need to say which they were, for
they were but typical of all the other regiments
in the Force that day.  Again there were but
a poor 200 men left of each 1,000.  Officers
and men alike in their pitiable destitution.
Barefooted, or shifts of bandages round their
swollen feet; torn breeches, cut short like
football knickers.  Great bearded men they were,
with the grime and dust of five terrible days'
incessant fighting and marching upon them;
but in their eyes the unquenchable light of
their native pluck and steadfastness.  There was
no trace of defeat there, only the hungry, dazed
look of men who long for a little sleep before
they turn once more to crash their way into an
enemy's ranks.
</p>

<p>
It is not such things as these that our people
at home are told, and so I set them down.
Tales of gallant deeds in the fighting-line they
have now in plenty, but the great human side
of this bloody war is passed over in discreet
silence.  England knows nothing of the
meaning of modern war; she has not suffered
invasion, save from the predatory attacks of
aircraft.  Her sons are fighting for her, and
the knowledge thrills our womenfolk; but of
the conditions under which they have fought,
and of the appalling sufferings of tortured
Belgium and France and Poland and Serbia,
they are hopelessly ignorant.  If but a tenth
part were thoroughly realised there would be
one mighty irresistible cry from the heart of
the civilised world:
</p>

<p>
"Stand at nothing to finish this war at once,
and it shall be the last!"
</p>

<p>
There are no such things as neutral nations.
If a nation refuses to be enrolled for Civilisation,
then it is fighting by the side of the
obscene Horror which has plunged Europe into
this carnival of blood and misery.
</p>

<p>
On the Friday afternoon some of us learned
from a wounded French lancer that the German
centre had been badly smashed and was actually
retiring from St. Quentin, owing to a French
counter-offensive; also some of our cavalry had
been doing specially good work south of that
town.  The 3rd Cavalry Brigade broke and beat
back the Prussian Guard and another cavalry
regiment, and the 5th Cavalry Brigade had a
similar success with other German cavalry.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime G.H.Q. had removed
still farther south to Compiègne, and occupied
Napoleon's magnificent palace, or a wing of it.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It had been intended to give the Force a
really good rest when they reached the River
Oise on the Friday night.  By that time the
British line (both Corps) ran along the river
from La Fère to Noyon.  But it was, after all,
little more than five or six hours which could
be spared; many of the regiments and batteries
did not even get that brief respite.  "Keep
moving" was still the order of the day.
</p>

<p>
But for the fortunate it was a glimpse of
Paradise.  It meant, above all else, a proper
all-over wash and a clean shirt, even though you
had to wash it yourself.  It meant the luxury
of a shave, if you could manage to get hold of
anything in the shape of a razor.  There was a
square meal served out, and there were two or
three hours of blessed sleep, when you lay with
next to nothing on (for your shirt was drying)
under a shady tree.  It was all little enough,
and, truth to tell, most of the men could only
turn out of the ranks to fall straight into the
sleep of utter exhaustion, a sleep of the clock
round had it been allowed.
</p>

<p>
Tobacco in those days was a luxury, and it
was needed most.  Now there is a regular
weekly ration, and in addition kind friends at
home see that the supply of cigarettes does not
fail.  But in the Retreat the usual substitute
was dried tea-leaves rolled in the parchment
paper of the emergency ration.  Tea-leaves are
very nasty to smoke, but I am not sure that they
are so nasty as brown paper or the seat of a
cane-bottomed chair; and I have tried them all.
</p>

<p>
The men's equipment, too, was a constant
source of trouble.  They would throw away
their greatcoats and packs, anything to march
as lightly as possible.  The Germans must have
had a fine haul, and there were several occasions
when they dressed up their infantry companies
in British greatcoats and caps, and got well up
to our lines before their identity was discovered.
</p>

<p>
And that reminds me that in Noyon we
caught a German spy wearing no fewer than
three different uniforms.  First, a French; over
it a Belgian; and on top of these a khaki
greatcoat with cap.  It was a very hot day, and the
man's obvious discomfort was the first thing to
give him away.  It did not take ten minutes
to settle that little affair.
</p>

<p>
By the time the two corps joined up again
the refugee problem had become really serious.
All the way back the army of unfortunates had
been steadily growing larger, and it was but
natural that they should hang on to the skirts
of the Force for protection.  How many of the
poor women and little children died of exposure
and exhaustion, it is impossible to tell.  Our
men were themselves badly off for food, but,
needless to say, they were always eager to share
their emergency rations with those who had
nothing at all save what could be garnered in
wayside village or cottage.
</p>

<p>
Rules about commandeering are most rigid;
nothing must be taken without payment, or at
least a voucher.  I remember one C.O. buying
a couple of fruit trees for his unit.  But it went
to the men's hearts to leave behind them tender
chickens and toothsome bunnies, even though
there was no chance of cooking them, to be
snapped up by Germans with no such qualms
of conscience.
</p>

<p>
Yet, to give the Germans credit, they did,
in many cases, give written receipts for
provisions when it was a question of an odd duck
or bale of hay; but when a house was properly
ransacked the receipt given more usually bore
the signature of that redoubtable warrior, Herr
von Koepenick.  It was one of the very few
occasions when they showed a sense of humour,
if one can call it so.
</p>

<p>
Amongst those fortunate regiments which
had been able to snatch the few hours' rest
there was a very general, and a very natural,
impression that a definite stand was now going
to be made.  The position was a good one, and
it was also confidently expected that more
divisions were being hurried out from England
as fast as ship and train could bring them.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps, under other circumstances, the
stand might indeed have been made.  But what
we did not know was that the main French
Armies away to the east were being dealt a
series of such smashing blows by the Germans
that they were retiring almost more quickly
than we were.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Although we are concerned here solely with
the fortunes of the British Force, yet it must
be remembered that the fighting on the west
was only a small part of the general engagement,
and that the Force had necessarily to
conform with the main strategical idea.  The
capture of Paris would have been of incalculable
moral value to the Germans.  They recognised
this, and therefore made that special bid for it.
But the triumphant entry into Paris would
have possessed no <i>real</i> value so long as the
French and British Armies were still "in
being."  Just as, later, the capture of Warsaw
was of little real value (save as a strategic
centre), because the Russian Armies had
escaped.
</p>

<p>
The position, then, on Saturday morning,
the 29th, was:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
(<i>a</i>) The Force was retiring, not too severely
pressed by the enemy, but with continuous
rear-guard actions.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
(<i>b</i>) Two new French Armies (the 6th and
7th) were coming into position on our
left, by Amiens and Roye.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
(<i>c</i>) On our immediate right was the 5th
French Army, the one which had
suffered so badly after the fall of Namur.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
(<i>d</i>) Generally, the French forces on the east
were being steadily pushed back by the
very strong enemy advance.
</p>

<p>
On that morning the Commander-in-Chief
received a visit from General Joffre, and this
is what took place.  I quote from Sir John
French's second dispatch:
</p>

<p>
"I strongly represented my position to the
French Commander-in-Chief, who was most
kind, cordial and sympathetic, as he has always
been.  He told me that he had directed the
5th French Army on the Oise to move forward
and attack the Germans on the Somme with a
view to checking pursuit.
</p>

<p>
"I finally arranged with General Joffre to
effect a further short retirement towards the
line Compiègne&mdash;Soissons, promising him,
however, to do my utmost to keep always within
a day's march of him."
</p>

<p>
It may be noted here (although, of course,
we did not know it till much later) that, owing
to the German advance on the west, Le Havre
was evacuated as the British base, and the
organisation, stores, hospitals and everything,
were rushed at half a day's notice right down
to St. Nazaire, at the mouth of the River
Loire.  It was an amusing episode in the war,
and quite a happy little yarn it would make;
"but that is another story," as Kipling says.
</p>

<p>
On the Saturday evening the Force was got
on the move again, heartened and not a little
refreshed.  The country-side now was as lovely
as any district in France.  Gentle, undulating
downs, crowned by the beautiful forest of
Ligues, and besprinkled with dainty little
villages and stately châteaux.  If these lines
should chance to be read by the mayor and
mayoress of a certain little village hard by
Compiègne, I would beg them to believe that
the officer whom they so graciously entertained
for those brief hours remembers their kindness
with the deepest gratitude, and records the day
as one of the most perfect he has ever spent.
Officers and men made so many good friends
even during those crowded hours of life, only
to realise with heartfelt sorrow that perhaps
half a day later their kindly hosts must have
been engulfed by the tide of invasion.
</p>

<p>
I vividly recall how curious seemed that
order to go on retiring when, from all accounts,
the German centre had the previous day been
so badly beaten.  Madame's instincts, when the
order came, were only too correct.  She guessed
the truth; we continued our trek hopelessly
blind to the real facts.

CHAPTER XIV
<br />
PAST COMPIÈGNE
</h3>

<p class="poem">
KING HENRY.  <i>The sum of all our answer is but this:<br />
  We would not seek a battle, as we are;<br />
  Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it.<br />
<span style="letter-spacing: 4em">*****</span><br />
  We are in God's hand, brother, not in theirs.<br />
  March to the bridge;<br />
  Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves,<br />
  And on to-morrow bid them march away.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The destruction of a bridge, especially if it
spans a river, always seems to me so pathetic.
Bridges are such companionable things; they
fall so readily into one's mood, and there are,
I imagine, few persons who do not possess
pleasant memories of one or another.  Whether
in town or country, there is always fascination
in staying one's journey for a few minutes to
lean over the parapet and watch the stream&mdash;the
basking of a trout amongst the pebbles, the
sway of the water-weeds, the trailing of heavy
barges, or the twinkling shore-lights.
</p>

<p>
In Compiègne there is a particularly
handsome structure which spans the River Oise.
The French people love a noble bridge to ferry
their broad highways over the rivers, and I
cannot help thinking that it was not alone
special reliance upon the workmanship of our
sappers which induced the French authorities to
resign to them the destruction.  For, whenever
possible, British sappers were called in for the
work.  They made such a clean job of it, the
French would say.  No; it was, I feel sure,
their affection and pride for beautiful works of
art with tender associations that made them
reluctant to lay sacrilegious hands upon them.
</p>

<p>
It must have been on Sunday, the 30th,
that the last of the Force marched through or
past Compiègne, and the bridge, besides many
another, was blown up.  The R.F.A. of the
rear-guard passed through the town and halted,
guns unlimbered, about 500 yards out the other
side, ready to open fire, if necessary, for they
were being hard pressed.  The fuses were laid
and lighted literally in face of the advancing
enemy, and two R.E. officers who were doing
the work were killed by enemy bullets.  With
a terrific crash the bridge fell, cut in two, and
the retirement was continued while the
Germans hurled impotent curses and (at that time)
ineffectual shells after the column.
</p>

<p>
The Second Corps had now reached country
which was very difficult; not only for manoeuvre,
but especially so for transport.  Immediately
after you leave Compiègne its glorious forest is
entered, and directly that is passed it is a country
of very steep ravines, thickly wooded, with little
villages clinging limpet-like to the ridges.  The
heat of the day, too, was most trying.
</p>

<p>
The First Corps, which had joined up at
Noyon, crossed the Aisne, and continued its
retirement via Soissons.
</p>

<p>
The German pursuit, which during the last
two or three days had seemed to slacken off,
began to get serious again on the afternoon of
Monday, the 31st.
</p>

<p>
About 3 P.M. three field batteries and
the Brigade of Guards (First Corps) were out
by Villers-Cotterets, and the Germans were
pushing on almost as fast as they did during
the first days.  Their guns came into action at
about 1,700 yards, and as our brigade there was
far outnumbered, orders were given to go on
retiring.
</p>

<p>
Well, the major of one of the batteries was
"fed up" with retiring without getting some
of his own back, so he put his telescope (a
battery carries a telescope) to his blind eye and
said he'd be hanged before he retired (or words
to that effect), and "let's give them a dressing
down first."
</p>

<p>
So it was "Halt; action right!" and, after
a couple of ranging shots, "Two rounds
gun-fire!"  And that was all that battery got in.
The Germans put a couple of guns out of action,
and then turned their attention to the wagon
line, where they made a considerable mess-up
with the teams.
</p>

<p>
That settled it.  "Signal the teams up and
let's get out of it!" said the major; and it was
so.  The quartermaster-sergeant put the fear of
God, not the Germans, into the drivers; up
came the teams, "rear limber up," and away
they went, damaged guns and all.  The Guards
meanwhile had gone on.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing particularly heroic about
it all, but it was very excusable, and it certainly
helped to buck the men up a little.
</p>

<p>
The Guards, however, gave further excellent
evidence of their fighting qualities in a series
of stiff hand-to-hand encounters in the forest
glades.  While they suffered badly, they
succeeded again and again in beating back the
enemy's attacks, and so further relieving the
pressure on the rear.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Now, despite the continuous fighting and
marching, there was no doubt whatever that the
men were daily becoming more war-hardened
and fit.  The worst was over, and with that firm
conviction their spirits grew lighter.  During
the first few days the troops were marching
perhaps 25 to 30 miles a day, apart from the
fighting.  Take, for instance, Wednesday, the
26th.  The men had begun that great fight
practically tired out.  They fought all day, and
then at the end of it did a retirement of some
25 miles.  Staff officers were simply worn out
by the nerve-racking ordeal, and General
Smith-Dorrien himself says that he did not average
more than two hours' sleep during the first six
days.
</p>

<p>
But the week's campaigning had done more
for the troops than ten years' peace work.
Their self-reliance, their confidence in and
affection for their officers were evidenced in a
hundred ways; while officers, for their part,
had perfect confidence in their men and knew
that, however impossible an order might seem,
it would be carried out.  The Force was, in
short, one big happy family.  Everybody seemed
to know everybody else, and that meant that
everybody helped everybody else.  After the
Marne it was never quite the same, because the
Force began to increase in size.  New-comers
were immediately recognised, and the old hands
could never resist a momentary exhibition of
very pardonable pride at having "been out since
the beginning."
</p>

<p>
The heavy losses in officers and N.C.O.'s
had an inevitable effect on discipline, though it
might well have been worse had not the sense
of discipline amongst the rank and file been so
strong.  It must be remembered that so soon
as the vanguard of the retiring Force passed
through a village, practically the whole of the
inhabitants would pack up such few of their
belongings as they could carry on light carts,
perambulators and any available vehicle, and
then join the ever-growing stream of refugees.
So the next units to pass through would find
nothing but empty houses, and the temptation
to carry away a few "souvenirs" was
very hard to check, especially in the case of
food.
</p>

<p>
One man of an infantry regiment "found"
a horse wandering loose in a field.  He was very
tired, so why, thought he, should he not take
what the gods sent him?  He did, and rode the
horse for a couple of days.  Knowing nothing
about horses, the poor beast got little enough
to eat, and the man thought that the heaven-sent
gift was becoming a nuisance.  So he
talked the matter over with a pal, and
swopped his charger for&mdash;a packet of
Woodbines!  And I don't think the pal was a canny
Scot either.
</p>

<p>
I remember particularly the date September
1st, and going through the little town of
Crépy-en-Valois, because we then realised for
the first time that something was wrong about
that "strategical retirement" business.  Our
maps included Belgium and all N.E. France,
but Compiègne was the farthest point south;
and when we had retired below that town we
knew that retreat so far south was not a part
of the original scheme.
</p>

<p>
Then most of us saw some French troops
for the first time, and, ominous sign, they
were always engaged in barricading and mining
the roads, opening the barricades to let us pass
through.
</p>

<p>
But Tuesday, September 1st, must ever be
a red-letter day in the annals of the Royal
Regiment, on account of the famous fight of
L Battery, R.H.A., at Nery, hard by Compiègne.
I always regard that episode as one of
the most wonderful incidents in this war.  Nor
do I think so because it was my own regiment,
though naturally one can appreciate it the more
from being a Gunner.  The story is, of course,
well known, but no repetition can mar the
effect, however bald the telling of it may be.
</p>

<p>
L Battery was working with the 1st Cavalry
Brigade, which was made up of the 2nd
Dragoons (Queen's Bays), the 11th Hussars,
and the 5th Dragoons.  For the benefit of the
uninitiated it may be explained that a horse
artillery battery of six guns forms an integral
part of a cavalry brigade; wherever the cavalry
go, there can go the "Horse Gunners," for
the gun is of lighter calibre than that of the
field batteries.
</p>

<p>
About 2 o'clock in the morning word
reached Second Corps H.Q. that a strong force
of Germans, 90 guns and cavalry, was moving
towards the 1st Cavalry Brigade in bivouac
at Nery.  The Third Army Corps, which was
still included in General Smith-Dorrien's
command, was also not far away.  Our cavalry were
actually bivouacked within about 600 yards of
the Germans, and I believe that our outposts
were, for some reason or other, not sufficiently
advanced.
</p>

<p>
In an earlier chapter, writing of Captain
Francis Grenfell, I have remarked that there
was one other to whose life might well be
applied the phrase: "<i>Sans peur et sans
reproche</i>."  That other was Captain E. K. Bradbury,
of L Battery.  All that I have ventured
to say of Grenfell I would say also of
Bradbury.  I doubt whether there ever lived a
Gunner officer who was more beloved by his
men, or one more worthy to be so beloved.
And when that is said, what else remains?
</p>

<p>
Half-past four in the morning, and the mists
have scarcely begun to rise above the beech
trees.  You picture the guns of L Battery
parked in line just on the downward slope of a
slight hill and in a little clearing of the woods.
The horses of the gun-teams are tethered to the
gun and limber-wheels; others are down at a
little stream hard by, where some of the men
are washing and scrubbing out their shirts.
The Queen's Bays are in bivouac in a neighbouring field.
</p>

<p>
"Some of our scouts out there, aren't
they?" remarked a shoeing-smith, pointing
to some rising ground about 500 yards to
the north; "or is it French cursers?"
(cuirassiers).
</p>

<p>
"Looks more like Germans to me," said
one of the gunners.  "Let's have a squint
through the telescope."
</p>

<p>
"What's up?" said the sergeant-major,
passing at the moment.
</p>

<p>
"Half a mo!" mumbled the gunner, eye
glued to the battery telescope.  "Yes, it
is&mdash;Germans&mdash;I can see the spiky helmets."
</p>

<p>
"Rot," returned the sergeant-major;
"can't be!"
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, I'm off to report to the
captain," said the gunner.
</p>

<p>
Bradbury was talking to the horses by
one of the guns when a breathless gunner
of the battery staff appeared with the
telescope.
</p>

<p>
"Beg pardon, sir, but there are&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
CRASH!  A percussion shell burst clean
in the middle of the battery, followed the next
instant by a couple more.  And in the few
moments' breathless pause it was realised that
practically every horse and every driver was
either killed outright or wounded.
</p>

<p>
"Action rear!" yelled Bradbury, who found
himself in command.
</p>

<p>
Their leader's voice above the unholy din
pulled them together, and the gun detachments,
such as were left, leaped to the trails to
get the limbers clear.  But no more than three
guns could they get into action.
</p>

<p>
Now a tornado of shell and machine-gun
bullets from close range burst over and through
the devoted remnant&mdash;Bradbury, three
subalterns (Giffard, Campbell and Mundy), the
sergeant-major, a sergeant, a couple of gunners,
and a driver.  And in action against them were
ten German field-guns, and two machine-guns
enfilading from the wood.
</p>

<p>
Of their three guns, they had now to abandon two.
</p>

<p>
"All hands number 2 gun!" called Bradbury,
who, with the sergeant, had already
opened fire.
</p>

<p>
The others rushed the few yards to
Bradbury's gun; but even in that short space
Giffard was hit five times.  Bradbury acted as
No. 1 (layer), the sergeant No. 2, while Mundy
acted as observing officer.  One of the gunners
and the driver carried across all the ammunition
by hand, through the hail of lead, from the
firing battery wagons.
</p>

<p>
The range was, say, 600 yards, but in such
a nerve-racking storm it was difficult for the
little detachment to work clearly with no one
to observe the burst of the shells.  There was
only a little chance, but Mundy took it, and
stepped calmly out from the shelter of the
gun-shield to observe.
</p>

<p>
Then No. 2 gun began its work in earnest.
</p>

<p>
"Five minutes more left," said Mundy;
"add twenty-five."
</p>

<p>
Crack went the report.  "One out!" said
Mundy.
</p>

<p>
"Ten minutes more right; drop twenty-five."
</p>

<p>
Crack again!  "Short," murmured Mundy;
then, "add twenty-five."
</p>

<p>
"Two out!" he counted.
</p>

<p>
When three German guns had been counted
out, Bradbury called over his shoulder to the
sergeant-major:
</p>

<p>
"Take my place; I'll load for a bit."
</p>

<p>
He had barely changed places when a bursting
shell carried away a leg at the thigh.  Yet,
by some superhuman will-power, he stuck to
his post and went on loading.
</p>

<p>
Now Mundy was mortally wounded.  Then
Campbell fell.  But still the gun was served,
laid, and fired.  And as surely were the German
guns being counted out, one by one.
</p>

<p>
Then there burst true another shell.  The
gallant Bradbury received his death-wound, and
his other leg was carried away.  The rest of the
detachment were all wounded.  Still that tiny
remnant stuck to it through the storm.
</p>

<p>
Now only are left the sergeant-major,
Sergeant Nelson, the gunner, and the driver.
Still they work.  Still they watch one enemy
gun after another ceasing to fire, until all are
counted out but one.
</p>

<p>
All the ammunition is finished.  Nothing
left now but to crawl back out of that hell.
I Battery coming up?  Well, they can finish
it.  Lend us some "wheelers" to get our guns
back.
</p>

<p>
So were the six guns of L Battery brought
out of action.  Torn and battered, but safe.
Glorious relics of perhaps the most wonderful
action a battery of the Regiment has ever
fought&mdash;and won.
</p>

<p>
I Battery opened on the massed columns of
the German cavalry now appearing, and rent
mighty lanes through their ranks, turned and
scattered them.  The Queen's Bays, who had
been working as infantry, for their horses
stampeded when the firing began, collected up,
and with I Battery and the Lincolns went over
the hill after the retiring enemy.
</p>

<p>
There they found the German battery out
of action and abandoned.
</p>

<p>
And Bradbury?  His last conscious words
were an appeal for morphia and to be carried
away as quickly as possible that his men might
not witness his agony and be unnerved.
</p>

<p>
So passed that heroic soul away.  A life
nobly spent, a death nobly encountered.
</p>

CHAPTER XV
<br />
THE FINAL STAGES
</h3>

<p class="poem">
FRENCH KING.  <i>'Tis certain he hath passed the river Somme.</i>
</p>

<p class="poem">
CONSTABLE OF FRANCE.  <i>And if he be not fought withal, my lord,<br />
  Let us not live in France: let us quit all,<br />
  And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The fighting in the neighbourhood of Compiègne
developed into something of a general
action, an action in which the British more than
held their own.  There was some doubt whether
the 4th Division would be able to shake off the
heavy attack which was being made upon them,
so another brigade was ordered to their help.
The retirement was then easily effected.
</p>

<p>
The 3rd Brigade was a little north of
Crépy-en-Valois, and, without waiting for the
enemy, themselves made a spirited advance for
a short distance, and did excellent work with
their R.F.A. against the German infantry.
</p>

<p>
Soon after midnight on Wednesday, September
2nd, the Force continued its retirement.
There may have been some little grumbling,
and it became increasingly difficult to keep up
the old fiction&mdash;now indeed a fact&mdash;about a
"strategical retirement"; but, somehow or
other, a genuine conviction was stealing through
the ranks that at any moment the real end would
come.  If our men were very, very weary, so
also were the enemy, and every day brought
fresh evidence of the fact.
</p>

<p>
Then, too, news came to us that the French
(the 7th Army) were really tackling von
Buelow's armies, and were doing well against
them.  That had a very inspiriting effect.
</p>

<p>
Now the Force, or rather our left, was
actually in sight of the outlying forts of Paris,
about a dozen miles off.  Great was the
excitement, for, of course, everyone jumped to the
conclusion that we were making for the capital.
G.H.Q. was at Lagny-sur-Marne, just 15 miles
due east of Paris.  They actually got as far
south as Melun, on the outskirts of the Forest
of Fontainebleau, before the tide turned.
</p>

<p>
If you look at these places on the picture-map
you will see that, after Senlis was passed,
the Force, instead of retiring straight on
towards Paris, as it had been doing, now swung
round, with the right flank of the First Corps
as pivot, and marched in a south-easterly
direction.  Possibly the enemy imagined from
this that their chance had come, and that they
would now be able to slip in between our left
and Paris.  But the new French army was
coming up from behind Paris, upon our left,
to fill the gap and cover the approaches to the
city.
</p>

<p>
That swinging round movement to cross the
River Marne was rather a risky business, for it
meant marching for a certain distance across
the enemy's front.  However, it was
successfully accomplished, and by the evening of
September 3rd the Force was south of the river.
That same afternoon our aircraft reported that
the Germans had also swung eastwards, and
were now apparently making for the large
town of Château-Thierry, the point of division
between our extreme right and the 5th French
Army.
</p>

<p>
The position in which the Force found themselves
that evening was wellnigh hopeless from
a defensive point of view.  To make matters
worse, we were very badly off for entrenching
tools, the men having lost the greater part in
the hurried retirement after the hard battle at
the Wednesday.  This question of entrenching
tools was further complicated by the removal of
our base to St. Nazaire, for that meant a much
more serious difficulty in getting up supplies.
</p>

<p>
I forgot to mention that when orders reached
the Second Corps and 4th Division on the
Thursday night to keep on the move, instructions
were given by G.H.Q. to abandon everything,
even the ammunition, which might retard
the transport, and so to leave the vehicles free
for wounded or the more exhausted of the men.
Only one Division carried out the order, and
that only partially, before the G.O.C. Second
Corps on the spot realised it was unnecessary
and countermanded it.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
During and after the battle of Le Cateau,
as I have said the fight of the Wednesday has
come to be spoken of, a rather curious adventure
befell one of the motor transport ammunition
parks About ten of the lorries, under an
A.S.C. subaltern, had been doing some detached
work away from the main body.  These had
got out of rather a tight corner, but the rest
of the park (some sixty odd lorries) had become
involved in that mix-up at Estrées.
</p>

<p>
About 3 P M. the A.S.C. captain in charge
received an order to go back in the direction of
Le Cateau.  This was, apparently, straight into
the advancing enemy, who were only some three
or four miles off.  The C.O. obeyed his orders
and took his lorries back.  From that moment
those sixty great lorries vanished into thin air,
and not a soul knew what had happened to
them.  At G.H.Q. the unit was officially
reported as "missing," and it so appeared, I
believe, in the London Press.
</p>

<p>
The subaltern invented and spread abroad a
delicious yarn.  I omit his version of his own
adventures, for he got a "mention in
dispatches" for it, though this was subsequently
quashed.
</p>

<p>
When the order to go back was received,
he said, and annihilation of the park seemed
certain, the O.C. called his subalterns together
and told them the position.  They unanimously
decided to obey and charge the advancing enemy
with the lorries.  The drivers (our old friends
the busmen) were instructed to go full speed
ahead into the enemy column.  But the drivers
were not having any.  So the officers produced
their revolvers and threatened to shoot any
man who refused to obey.  That decided them.
"We will die by German bullets rather than
British."  So away they went, the lorries
bumping along the road straight into the ranks of
the astonished Germans.  Nothing could stop
them, and the column got through (the narrator
forgot to mention where to) with the loss of
about half the park.
</p>

<p>
The subaltern carried his arm in a sling for
a fortnight afterwards.  A shrapnel splinter, he
said, when they were rushing the enemy.  It
had really been caused by the back-fire of a
motor-bike.  Possibly this is the origin of that
glorified picture which appeared in certain of
the London illustrated papers.
</p>

<p>
The park was, however, actually lost for
nearly a week.  They had vanished as
completely as though the earth had opened and
swallowed them.  They were eventually heard
of by the merest accident, when a sergeant came
in to one of the towns on the line of retreat to
get provisions.  But even then they could not
be found, for the sergeant had gone again
without leaving his address.  So for days Staff
officers scoured the country in swift cars, and
thus the park was eventually run to earth.  No
one was more surprised than the C.O. to hear
that he had been lost.  They had not seen a
single German, and they had had such a jolly
time, thank you, seeing the pretty country.
</p>

<p>
But to tell of half the curious or amusing
incidents I should need a volume many times
the size of this one.  Things happened every
day any one of which would provide a newspaper
with a column of excellent "copy."  At
the time one thought little about them, for
everybody was too busy looking after his job
and himself.  There was, for instance, the
Adventure of the Flat-Nosed Bullet, the
Adventure of the Man with the Crooked Ear, the
Adventure of the Field Cashier and the Pay
Chest, the Adventure of the Blood-stained
Putty Knife, the Adventure of the Perishing
Cat, and many another.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The great question on the morning of
Friday, September 4th, was: "Are we going
right back to the Seine, with our left on
Paris?"  You picture the Force, tired enough but in
most excellent fettle, growing hourly more
impatient, longing with all their hearts to turn
and have a go at the enemy who had caused
them all that trouble and discomfort.
</p>

<p>
"Give a guess," I asked two of my
sergeants that day, "how long we have been
out here?"
</p>

<p>
They thought for a few minutes.  "Six
weeks," they said; "perhaps seven."
</p>

<p>
And, you see, it was only a fortnight after
all.  But they would not believe it until a
calendar was produced.  Unconsciously
everyone reckoned each night as another day, for
nights and days were alike so far as work was
concerned.  I think that remark was more
telling than pages of descriptive writing.
</p>

<p>
The days during those final stages were
almost tropical in their heat, which told very
severely on men and horses.  The nights were
chill and wet.  So altogether one had one's work
cut out in mothering the men.  Cases of bowel
complaints were very common, and one has to
be so careful to prevent serious developments.
The lads really need looking after like children,
bless them!  Aromatic chalk-powder with opium
(5-grain tablets) I found an excellent remedy,
and cured dozens of cases.  So there is a little
tip for other officers.  Calomel is useful, too,
and I saved much agony from bad wounds by
doses of opium (1-grain tablets), but this must
not be given in cases of stomach wounds&mdash;most
to be dreaded of any.  Aspirin, also, is, of
course, invaluable.  Certainly no officer should
be without a small medicine-case, and it is the
one thing they never seem to think of when
getting kit together.  A trivial lapse, this, into
egotism, I am afraid.  I hope it will be excused
for the sake of the hints offered.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In the evening of September 4th orders
came to continue the retirement still farther.
The Second Corps marched through most of the
night towards the River Seine, the First Corps
conforming to the movement on the east.  The
6th French Army was coming up well on our
left, and thus the western end of the Franco-British
line was gradually swinging round and
up between Paris and the right flank of the
Germans, who were now definitely moving
east-south-east.  You must remember, though, that
these facts were only apparent at the time to a
handful of officers of the Headquarters Staff;
everyone else was still in the dark.  But how
thrilling those hours must have been to an
airman observing from above, and who knew the
facts.
</p>

<p>
On the 5th (Saturday), at noon, one battery
found itself halted in a field by the 12-kilometre
stone from Paris, and the men were confident
that "la ville lumière" was their next stop.
There was an undercurrent of excitement, for
another couple of thousand men had joined
up to the corps as reinforcements.  It was a
definite halt and a rest, the first they had
had since Mons, and they were making the most
of it.
</p>

<p>
Just about 6 P.M. the major came into the
lines with a paper in his hand.  There was
something in his walk, something about
him&mdash;the men jumped up as he approached.
"Paris?"&mdash;the major shook his head.
"Not&mdash;not&mdash;is it advance, sir?"  The major
nodded.  "We are going to advance," he said.
</p>

<p>
ADVANCE!
</p>

<p>
There was a cheer which must have startled
the French Government in Bordeaux, or
whereever they had gone to.
</p>

<p>
The drivers rushed at their horses, the
gunners rushed to the limbers to help hook in.
"Stand to your horses!" sang out the sergeant-major.
Then, in a very few minutes: "Battery
all ready, sir!"
</p>

<p>
The major stood up in his stirrups with a
splendid laugh in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Sub-sections right-about-wheel!  Walk, march!"
</p>

<p>
Another rousing shout, which soon merged
into the cheery strains of "All aboard for
Dixie," and the battery began a march, this
time in the right direction, which only stopped
at 2 A.M. for the sake of the horses.  The men
were ready to go on for a week.
</p>

<p>
The great Retreat had ended.  The Advance
had begun.
</p>

<p>
How and why the tide turned against the
invaders at that, for them, most critical moment
we cannot exactly tell.  It was, as I see it, a
combination of circumstances.  There was the
imminence of the Russian invasion into Prussia,
and it was said that the Germans withdrew two
army corps from the Western front to meet it.
There was the sudden production by the French
Commander-in-Chief of an entirely new French
army from behind Paris to attack the German
right.
</p>

<p>
But one thing, at least, is certain.  Von
Kluck made, perhaps, the biggest mistake in
his life in imagining that "the contemptible
little army" which he and his legions had been
hunting for a fortnight was now too dispirited
and broken for further fighting; and, with that
conviction in his mind, he started to do the very
thing which the most elementary military
textbooks tell you is absolutely wrong.  He moved
his army across the unbroken front of a hostile
force.
</p>

<p>
General Smith-Dorrien had been compelled
to do the same thing with the Second Corps only
three days before.  But he did it with the full
knowledge of the dangers, and he took every
possible precaution to obviate them.  He
succeeded.
</p>

<p>
Von Kluck, in his delusion, saw no danger.
He failed.
</p>

<p>
"I should conceive it," says Sir John
French, "to have been about noon on September
6th ... that the enemy realised the powerful
threat that was being made against the flank of
his columns moving south-east, and began the
great retreat which opened the battle of the
Marne."
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
And there I draw the tableau curtains on
the first act of the drama.
</p>

<p>
How inadequately the story has been told, or
rather outlined, no one is more conscious than
the writer.  For every omission the critics may
find, I will find two.  But if I have so written
that the great-hearted public may realise a little
more of what the Retreat from Mons meant to
the lads of ours who worked and fought so
marvellously, to themselves at home, to our
brothers and sisters overseas, then indeed I am
satisfied.
</p>

<p>
Of necessity I have had to omit a great deal
which may not be told until the war has ended.
To an officer on the active list freedom of speech
is rightly denied.  But some day I shall hope
to write in fuller detail and to do more justice
to the work of individuals.  It is only right that
the public should learn the actual facts.
</p>

<p>
The glory of the achievement lay not merely
in the hourly repulse, over a period of fourteen
days, of an overwhelming attack, and of a
continued retirement, which somehow never broke,
before such an inveterate pursuit.  But there
was also the big question of temperament.  The
Germans knew exactly what they wanted, and
they went straight for it, backed by all the
resources of their wonderful organisation working
to that particular end for a decade of years
or longer.  The British, on the other hand, were
thrust into the breach literally at the last
moment, a week late, and then had to fight for
a fortnight in total ignorance of the course of
events.
</p>

<p>
I recall a remark once made by General Joffre:
</p>

<p>
"The better he understands the importance
of the movements of the attack wherein he
participates, the braver the French soldier
fights, and the more trust he puts in the
measures taken by his leaders."
</p>

<p>
While the converse may not always be true,
it will, I think, suggest how very difficult is the
execution of a delicate piece of strategy when
the officers and men are ignorant of the motives
which prompt it.
</p>

<p>
The Retreat was carried to a successful
conclusion because, by the inherent qualities of
race, it was a piece of work of a character in
which the British Army has always excelled;
and also, in face of the terrible engines of
modern slaughter, because of the splendid
discipline of the men and their training as
individual human beings.
</p>

<p>
Of the invariable cheerfulness of the men I
have given several examples; but I would again
attempt to correct the popular impression that
such cheerfulness is no more than the cracking
of jokes on all occasions.  No, it is something
far deeper and finer than that.  The casual
observer will watch a party of sappers mending
a road, under fire, with loads of flint stones.
He will hear them grumbling about the shocking
waste of the ratepayers' money, and will
then write home a letter for publication narrating
the incident as a funny remark under fire.
He omits to point out that it is only the cheery
spirits of the men (and, of course, discipline,
etc.) which make possible the clean finish of
the work.
</p>

<p>
So it was in the Retreat.  The men were
far too exhausted to crack jokes, but the
unconquerable soul of them rose high above every
obstacle, and so the work was done.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Looking back over what I have written, I
find that, quite unconsciously, I have said little
or nothing of the work of the officers.  Yet
there is nothing else that I can say.  It is not
for me to remark upon the work of our leaders
and of my brother-officers.  I can only repeat
the words of the Commander-in-Chief, and I
venture to do so because the general public
bothers but little with official dispatches.
</p>

<p>
"It is impossible," Sir John French
remarked, "for me to speak too highly of the
skill evinced by the two General Officers
Commanding Army Corps; the self-sacrificing and
devoted exertions of their Staffs; the direction
of the troops by Divisional, Brigade and
Regimental leaders; the command of the smaller
units by their officers; and the magnificent
fighting spirit displayed by non-commissioned
officers and men."
</p>

<p>
But in the Commander-in-Chief's dispatches
there is one officer whose name shines out like
a beacon.  You who have followed in spirit the
work of the Second Corps on August 26th will
have realised the imperishable debt which the
nation owes to the General Officer Commanding
that corps.  The verdict of posterity will but
confirm that of the present generation.
</p>

<p>
Again I can but quote the Commander-in-Chief:
</p>

<p>
"I cannot close the brief account of this
glorious stand of the British troops without
putting on record my deep appreciation of the
valuable services rendered by General Sir Horace
Smith-Dorrien.
</p>

<p>
"I say without hesitation that the saving of
the left wing of the Army under my command
on the morning of August 26th could never
have been accomplished unless a commander of
rare and unusual coolness, intrepidity and
determination had been present to personally conduct
the operation."
</p>

<p>
At the head of my sketch of that day's work
I have set Shakespeare's immortal lines on
St. Crispin's Day.  May one who was privileged to
serve as a member of that "band of brothers"
on that day venture to offer his poor tribute to
the leader of that band?
</p>

<p>
From Mons to the Marne, wherever the fight
was hottest, wherever his men were working
against heaviest odds, there was the General at
hand to help and stiffen them.  The outposts
before Mons were heavily engaged; the General
was up with them, under shell-fire, to see how
things were going.  Through the days that
followed, wherever opportunity served, their
commander stepped from his car to say a few
words of cheery encouragement to the passing
troops.  Was there a field hospital, a passing
ambulance?&mdash;again, those few words of kindly
inquiry which made the poor sufferers forget
everything save only the desire to be well again
to give their-chief, and Britain, all that was in
them.  If the Commander-in-Chief owed so
much to General Smith-Dorrien, I can only say
that the Second Corps would have stormed the
gates of Hell for their leader, and would have
trusted implicitly in him to bring them through.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I seem to have said practically nothing
about the Flying Corps, and very little about
the Sappers.  I am afraid that I saw very little
of our aeroplane work until the Aisne, and so
I cannot speak from personal observation.  In
fact, there are far too many omissions in this
brief chronicle.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But pardon, gentles all,<br />
<span style="letter-spacing: 4em">*****</span><br />
  Oh, pardon! since a crooked figure may<br />
  Attest in little place a million;<br />
  And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,<br />
  On your imaginary forces work,<br />
/tb
  Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Indeed, I find it quite impossible to speak
of one branch of the Force more than another.
It was just one perfect whole.  Thus I have,
so far as possible, refrained from designating
particular regiments.  If I have written of the
9th Lancers or L Battery it is because the
gallant work of those units is already a
household word throughout the Empire.  But, so far
as that first fortnight was concerned, there was
not a single unit, officer or man, who did not
achieve something equally as gallant did the
opportunity come his way.  Indeed, had it
not been so, the Retreat could never have been
accomplished as it was.  Every man played the
game for his side, and, in consequence, that
side won.
</p>

<p>
And if that were so, then there can be no
question of "mentions in dispatches," D.S.O.'s
and D.C.M.'s.  Every regiment in the firing-line
should be "mentioned."  If, by great good
fortune, a regiment achieves some specially
noble piece of work which comes to the notice
of the authorities, then, say I, let the Colour
of that regiment be decorated.  To single out
individuals, to give a Victoria Cross to the
colonel, a D.S.O. to the senior major, a Military
Cross to the senior captain, and so on, is to
create jealousy, and is, also, unfair to others.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Humanity, the other noble trait in the
character of our men, I have barely mentioned,
for it seems quite unnecessary to do so.  It is
a characteristic of British sailors and soldiers
which is always taken for granted.  One need
only recall some of the many occasions in our
naval actions when British sailors have rescued
Germans at the peril of their lives, and have
been fired at while doing so.  And set in
contrast the murderous attack by German destroyers
upon the crew of a British submarine stranded
on the Swedish coast.
</p>

<p>
And so it has been with our soldiers.  Our
men invariably enter a fight with the innate
feeling that it is a sporting contest, where you
shake hands with your adversary before and
after the fight.  If he knocks out his adversary,
then the winner is the man to help him to his
feet.
</p>

<p>
We have seen from the very beginning that
"chivalry" and "fair play" are words
unknown to the Germans.  To them nothing
matters but to win, preferably by foul means.
So, on the very first day, British soldiers were
terribly undeceived.  They saw German infantry
advancing to the attack behind a screen of
Belgian women and children, driven on at the
bayonet point.  From then onwards we lost
hundreds of gallant men simply through their
feelings of humanity towards wounded enemies,
being shot at by other Germans, or being
treacherously shot or stabbed by the very man
to whose lips they were holding a flask of
water.
</p>

<p>
And yet, with such examples before them
of their comrades' fate, the sense of humanity
and chivalry was never dulled.  Despite the
stringent orders on the subject, the men, even
now, hesitate to fire when the enemy raises a
white flag, and will always, whenever possible,
succour a wounded German lying before the
trench.  These are the men who have only, as
yet, learned of German treachery by hearsay
evidence.  But there are others.  There are
companies and battalions who know from ghastly
experience.  These men adopt other methods.
</p>

<p>
But nothing I can write will make people
at home understand what this war really is.
Nothing, short of actual experience, can do
that.  Stay, perhaps there is one thing: the
genius of Louis Raemaekers.  He, at least, by
his cartoons, is bringing home to millions the
hideous meaning of this war.  And not only
of this war, but of all modern war.  I would
have a volume of his cartoons distributed gratis
by the Government to every household in the
kingdom.  I would have half a dozen of the
cartoons thrown upon the screen in every
cinema-house at every entertainment.  The
people would shudder with horror, but they
would see them and learn what Germany is and
what war means.
</p>

<p>
Apart from this, I hold it to be the sacred
duty of every man and woman who can use a
pen to advantage, or who can command the
attention of an audience, to make known this
meaning.  To cry from the housetops what is
this foul thing which Germany has thrust upon
the world, and to show the people why and
how Civilisation must crush it out for ever.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There is no greater honour to-day that a
man may wear&mdash;alas, there are but few left to
wear it!&mdash;than the honour of having served his
King and Country in France throughout August
and September, 1914.  Just that.  He needs no
decoration, no "mention."  He served through
the "Retreat from Mons."  In days to come
our children, our children's children, will point
with pride to that one little word on the
regimental colour, "Mons."  For in that single
word will be summed up the Liberation of the
World.  It was the victory of the Marne which
won for Civilisation that freedom, but it was,
under God's hand, the British Navy, the stand
of Belgium, and the "Retreat from Mons"
which made that victory possible.

<p class="t3">
MILITARY DESPATCHES FROM THE FIELD-MARSHAL<br />
COMMANDING-IN-CHIEF, BRITISH FORCES IN THE FIELD,<br />
DATED SEPTEMBER 7TH AND 17TH
</p>

<p class="noindent">
7th September, 1914.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
MY LORD,
</p>

<p>
I have the honour to report the proceedings of the
Field Force under my command up to the time of
rendering this despatch.
</p>

<p>
1. The transport of the troops from England both by
sea and by rail was effected in the best order and without
a check.  Each unit arrived at its destination in this
country well within the scheduled time.
</p>

<p>
The concentration was practically complete on the
evening of Friday, the 21st ultimo, and I was able to
make dispositions to move the Force during Saturday,
the 22nd, to positions I considered most favourable
from which to commence operations which the French
Commander-in-Chief, General Joffre, requested me to
undertake in pursuance of his plans in prosecution of the
campaign.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Position at Mons
</p>

<p>
The line taken up extended along the line of the canal
from Condé on the west, through Mons and Binche on
the east.  This line was taken up as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
From Condé to Mons inclusive was assigned to the
Second Corps, and to the right of the Second Corps from
Mons the First Corps was posted.  The 5th Cavalry
Brigade was placed at Binche.
</p>

<p>
In the absence of my Third Army Corps I desired to
keep the Cavalry Division as much as possible as a reserve
to act on my outer flank, or move in support of any
threatened part of the line.  The forward reconnaissance
was entrusted to Brigadier-General Sir Philip Chetwode
with the 5th Cavalry Brigade, but I directed General
Allenby to send forward a few squadrons to assist in
this work.
</p>

<p>
During the 22nd and 23rd these advanced squadrons
did some excellent work, some of them penetrating as
far as Soignies, and several encounters took place in
which our troops showed to great advantage.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Sunday, August 23
</p>

<p>
2. At 6 a.m., on August 23rd, I assembled the
Commanders of the First and Second Corps and Cavalry
Division at a point close to the position, and explained
the general situation of the Allies, and what I
understood to be General Joffre's plan.  I discussed with
them, at some length the immediate situation in front
of us.
</p>

<p>
From information I received from French Headquarters
I understood that little more than one, or at
most two, of the enemy's Army Corps, with perhaps one
Cavalry Division, were in front of my position; and I
was aware of no attempted outflanking movement by
the enemy.  I was confirmed in this opinion by the fact
that my patrols encountered no undue opposition in their
reconnoitring operations.  The observation of my
aeroplanes seemed also to bear out this estimate.
</p>

<p>
About 3 p.m. on Sunday, the 23rd, reports began
coming in to the effect that the enemy was commencing
an attack on the Mons line, apparently in some strength,
but that the right of the position from Mons and Bray
was being particularly threatened.
</p>

<p>
The Commander of the First Corps had pushed his
flank back to some high ground south of Bray, and the
5th Cavalry Brigade evacuated Binche, moving slightly
south: the enemy thereupon occupied Binche.
</p>

<p>
The right of the 3rd Division, under General Hamilton,
was at Mons, which formed a somewhat dangerous
salient; and I directed the Commander of the Second
Corps to be careful not to keep the troops on this salient
too long, but, if threatened seriously, to draw back the
centre behind Mons.  This was done before dark.  In
the meantime, about 5 p.m., I received a most unexpected
message from General Joffre by telegraph, telling me
that at least three German Corps, viz., a reserve corps,
the 4th Corps and the 9th Corps, were moving on my
position in front, and that the Second Corps was engaged
in a turning movement from the direction of Tournay.
He also informed me that the two reserve French Divisions
and the 5th French Army on my right were retiring,
the Germans having on the previous day gained possession
of the passages of the Sambre between Charleroi
and Namur.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Monday, August 24
</p>

<p>
3. In view of the possibility of my being driven from
the Mons position, I had previously ordered a position
in rear to be reconnoitred.  This position rested on the
fortress of Maubeuge on the right and extended west to
Jenlain, south-east of Valenciennes, on the left.  The
position was reported difficult to hold, because standing
crops and buildings made the siting of trenches very
difficult and limited the field of fire in many important
localities.  It nevertheless afforded a few good artillery
positions.
</p>

<p>
When the news of the retirement of the French and
the heavy German threatening on my front reached me,
I endeavoured to confirm it by aeroplane reconnaissance;
and as a result of this I determined to effect a retirement
to the Maubeuge position at daybreak on the 24th.
</p>

<p>
A certain amount of fighting continued along the
whole line throughout the night, and at daybreak on the
24th the 2nd Division from the neighbourhood of
Harmignies made a powerful demonstration as if to retake
Binche.  This was supported by the artillery of both the
1st and 2nd Divisions, whilst the 1st Division took up
a supporting position in the neighbourhood of Peissant.
Under cover of this demonstration the Second Corps
retired on the line Dour&mdash;Quarouble&mdash;Frameries.  The 3rd
Division on the right of the Corps suffered considerable
loss in this operation from the enemy, who had retaken
Mons.
</p>

<p>
The Second Corps halted on this line, where they
partially entrenched themselves, enabling Sir Douglas
Haig with the First Corps gradually to withdraw to the
new position; and he effected this without much further
loss, reaching the line Bavai&mdash;Maubeuge about 7 p.m.
Towards midday the enemy appeared to be directing his
principal effort against our left.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Work of the Cavalry
</p>

<p>
I had previously ordered General Allenby with the
Cavalry to act vigorously in advance of my left front
and endeavour to take the pressure off.
</p>

<p>
About 7.30 a.m. General Allenby received a message
from Sir Charles Fergusson, commanding 5th Division,
saying that he was very hard pressed and in urgent need
of support.  On receipt of this message General Allenby
drew in the Cavalry and endeavoured to bring direct
support to the 5th Division.
</p>

<p>
During the course of this operation General De Lisle,
of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade, thought he saw a good
opportunity to paralyse the further advance of the enemy's
infantry by making a mounted attack on his flank.  He
formed up and advanced for this purpose, but was held
up by wire about 500 yards from his objective, and the
9th Lancers and 18th Hussars suffered severely in the
retirement of the Brigade.
</p>

<p>
The 19th Infantry Brigade, which had been guarding
the Line of Communications, was brought up by rail to
Valenciennes on the 22nd and 23rd.  On the morning of
the 24th they were moved out to a position south of
Quarouble to support the left flank of the Second Corps.
</p>

<p>
With the assistance of the Cavalry Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien
was enabled to effect his retreat to a new position;
although, having two corps of the enemy on his
front and one threatening his flank, he suffered great
losses in doing so.
</p>

<p>
At nightfall the position was occupied by the Second
Corps to the west of Bavai, the First Corps to the right.
The right was protected by the Fortress of Maubeuge,
the left by the 19th Brigade in position between Jenlain
and Bry, and the Cavalry on the outer flank.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Tuesday, August 25
</p>

<p>
4. The French were still retiring, and I had no
support except such as was afforded by the Fortress of
Maubeuge; and the determined attempts of the enemy
to get round my left flank assured me that it was his
intention to hem me against that place and surround
me.  I felt that not a moment must be lost in retiring
to another position.
</p>

<p>
I had every reason to believe that the enemy's forces
were somewhat exhausted, and I knew that they had
suffered heavy losses.  I hoped, therefore, that his pursuit
would not be too vigorous to prevent me effecting my
object.
</p>

<p>
The operation, however, was full of danger and
difficulty, not only owing to the very superior force in my
front, but also to the exhaustion of the troops.
</p>

<p>
The retirement was recommenced in the early morning
of the 25th to a position in the neighbourhood of
Le Cateau, and rearguards were ordered to be clear of
the Maubeuge&mdash;Bavai&mdash;Eth road by 5.30 a.m.
</p>

<p>
Two Cavalry Brigades, with the Divisional Cavalry
of the Second Corps, covered the movement of the Second
Corps.  The remainder of the Cavalry Division with the
19th Brigade, the whole under the command of General
Allenby, covered the west flank.
</p>

<p>
The 4th Division commenced its detrainment at Le
Cateau on Sunday, the 23rd, and by the morning of the
25th eleven battalions and a Brigade of Artillery with
Divisional Staff were available for service.
</p>

<p>
I ordered General Snow to move out to take up a
position with his right south of Solesmes, his left resting
on the Cambrai&mdash;Le Cateau road south of La Chaprie.
In this position the Division rendered great help to the
effective retirement of the Second and First Corps to the
new position.
</p>

<p>
Although the troops had been ordered to occupy the
Cambrai&mdash;Le Cateau&mdash;Landrecies position, and the ground
had, during the 25th, been partially prepared and
entrenched, I had grave doubts&mdash;owing to the information
I received as to the accumulating strength of the enemy
against me&mdash;as to the wisdom of standing there to fight.
</p>

<p>
Having regard to the continued retirement of the
French on my right, my exposed left flank, the tendency
of the enemy's western corps (II.) to envelop me, and,
more than all, the exhausted condition of the troops, I
determined to make a great effort to continue the retreat
till I could put some substantial obstacle, such as the
Somme or the Oise, between my troops and the enemy,
and afford the former some opportunity of rest and
reorganisation.  Orders were, therefore, sent to the Corps
Commanders to continue their retreat as soon as they
possibly could towards the general line
Vermand&mdash;St. Quentin&mdash;Ribemont.
</p>

<p>
The Cavalry, under General Allenby, were ordered to
cover the retirement.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
The Guards at Landrecies
</p>

<p>
Throughout the 25th and far into the evening, the
First Corps continued its march on Landrecies, following
the road along the eastern border of the Forêt de Mormal,
and arrived at Landrecies about 10 o'clock.  I had
intended that the Corps should come farther west so as
to fill up the gap between Le Cateau and Landrecies,
but the men were exhausted and could not get farther
in without rest.
</p>

<p>
The enemy, however, would not allow them this rest,
and about 9.30 p.m. a report was received that the 4th
Guards Brigade in Landrecies was heavily attacked by
troops of the 9th German Army Corps who were coming
through the forest on the north of the town.  This
brigade fought most gallantly and caused the enemy to
suffer tremendous loss in issuing from the forest into
the narrow street of the town.  The loss has been
estimated from reliable sources at from 700 to 1,000.  At
the same time information reached me from Sir Douglas
Haig that his 1st Division was also heavily engaged
south and east of Maroilles.  I sent urgent messages to
the Commander of the two French Reserve Divisions on
my right to come up to the assistance of the First Corps,
which they eventually did.  Partly owing to this assistance
but mainly to the skilful manner in which Sir
Douglas Haig extricated his Corps from an exceptionally
difficult position in the darkness of the night, they were
able at dawn to resume their march south towards
Wessigny on Guise.
</p>

<p>
By about 6 p.m. the Second Corps had got into
position with their right on Le Cateau, their left in the
neighbourhood of Caudry, and the line of defence was
continued thence by the 4th Division towards Seranvillers,
the left being thrown back.
</p>

<p>
During the fighting on the 24th and 25th the
Cavalry became a good deal scattered, but by the
early morning of the 26th General Allenby had
succeeded in concentrating two brigades to the south of
Cambrai.
</p>

<p>
The 4th Division was placed under the orders of the
General Officer Commanding the Second Army Corps.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Wednesday, August 26
</p>

<p>
On the 24th the French Cavalry Corps, consisting of
three divisions, under General Sordêt, had been in billets
north of Avesnes.  On my way back from Bavai, which
was my "Poste de Commandement" during the fighting
of the 23rd and 24th, I visited General Sordêt, and
earnestly requested his co-operation and support.  He
promised to obtain sanction from his Army Commander
to act on my left flank, but said that his horses were too
tired to move before the next day.  Although he rendered
me valuable assistance later on in the course of the
retirement, he was unable for the reasons given to afford
me any support on the most critical day of all, viz.,
the 26th.
</p>

<p>
At daybreak it became apparent that the enemy was
throwing the bulk of his strength against the left of the
position occupied by the Second Corps and the 4th
Division.
</p>

<p>
At this time the guns of four German Army Corps
were in position against them, and Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien
reported to me that he judged it impossible to
continue his retirement at daybreak (as ordered) in face
of such an attack.
</p>

<p>
I sent him orders to use his utmost endeavours to
break off the action and retire at the earliest possible
moment, as it was impossible for me to send him any
support, the First Corps being at the moment incapable
of movement.
</p>

<p>
The French Cavalry Corps, under General Sordêt, was
coming up on our left rear early in the morning, and I
sent an urgent message to him to do his utmost to come
up and support the retirement of my left flank; but,
owing to the fatigue of his horses he found himself unable
to intervene in any way.
</p>

<p>
There had been no time to entrench the position
properly, but the troops showed a magnificent front to
the terrible fire which confronted them.
</p>

<p>
The Artillery, although outmatched by at least four
to one, made a splendid fight, and inflicted heavy losses
on their opponents.
</p>

<p>
At length it became apparent that, if complete annihilation
was to be avoided, a retirement must be attempted;
and the order was given to commence it about 3.30 p.m.
The movement was covered with the most devoted
intrepidity and determination by the Artillery, which had
itself suffered heavily, and the fine work done by the
Cavalry in the further retreat from the position assisted
materially in the final completion of this most difficult
and dangerous operation.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately the enemy had himself suffered too
heavily to engage in an energetic pursuit.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I cannot close the brief account of this glorious stand
of the British troops without putting on record my deep
appreciation of the valuable services rendered by General
Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien.
</p>

<p>
I say without hesitation that the saving of the left
wing of the Army under my command on the morning
of the 26th August could never have been accomplished
unless a commander of rare and unusual coolness, intrepidity,
and determination had been present to personally
conduct the operations.
</p>

<p>
The retreat was continued far into the night of the
26th and through the 27th and 28th, on which date the
troops halted on the line Noyon&mdash;Chauny&mdash;La Fère,
having then thrown off the weight of the enemy's pursuit.
</p>

<p>
On the 27th and 28th I was much indebted to
General Sordêt and the French Cavalry Division which
he commands for materially assisting my retirement
and successfully driving back some of the enemy on
Cambrai.
</p>

<p>
General D'Amade also, with the 61st and 62nd French
Reserve Divisions, moved down from the neighbourhood
of Arras on the enemy's right flank and took much
pressure off the rear of the British Forces.
</p>

<p>
This closes the period covering the heavy fighting
which commenced at Mons on Sunday afternoon, 23rd
August, and which really constituted a four days' battle.
</p>

<p>
At this point, therefore, I propose to close the present
despatch.
</p>

<p>
I deeply deplore the very serious losses which the
British Forces have suffered in this great battle; but
they were inevitable in view of the fact that the British
Army&mdash;only two days after a concentration by rail&mdash;was
called upon to withstand a vigorous attack of five
German Army Corps.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible for me to speak too highly of the skill
evinced by the two General Officers commanding Army
Corps; the self-sacrificing and devoted exertions of their
Staffs; the direction of the troops by Divisional, Brigade,
and Regimental Leaders; the command of the smaller
units by their officers; and the magnificent fighting spirit
displayed by non-commissioned officers and men.
</p>

<p>
I wish particularly to bring to your Lordship's notice
the admirable work done by the Royal Flying Corps
under Sir David Henderson.  Their skill, energy, and
perseverance have been beyond all praise.  They have
furnished me with the most complete and accurate
information which has been of incalculable value in the
conduct of the operations.  Fired at constantly both by
friend and foe, and not hesitating to fly in every kind of
weather, they have remained undaunted throughout.
</p>

<p>
Further, by actually fighting in the air, they have
succeeded in destroying five of the enemy's machines.
</p>

<p>
I wish to acknowledge with deep gratitude the
incalculable assistance I received from the General and Personal
Staffs at Headquarters during this trying period.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant-General Sir Archibald Murray, Chief of
the General Staff; Major-General Wilson, Sub-Chief of
the General Staff; and all under them have worked day
and night unceasingly with the utmost skill, self-sacrifice,
and devotion; and the same acknowledgment is due by
me to Brigadier-General Hon. W. Lambton, my Military
Secretary, and the Personal Staff.
</p>

<p>
In such operations as I have described, the work of
the Quartermaster-General is of an extremely onerous
nature.  Major-General Sir William Robertson has met
what appeared to be almost insuperable difficulties with
his characteristic energy, skill, and determination; and
it is largely owing to his exertions that the hardships and
sufferings of the troops&mdash;inseparable from such
operations&mdash;were not much greater.
</p>

<p>
Major-General Sir Nevil Macready, the Adjutant-General,
has also been confronted with most onerous and
difficult tasks in connection with disciplinary arrangements
and the preparation of casualty lists.  He has been
indefatigable in his exertions to meet the difficult
situations which arose.
</p>

<p>
I have not yet been able to complete the list of officers
whose names I desire to bring to your Lordship's notice
for services rendered during the period under review;
and, as I understand it is of importance that this despatch
should no longer be delayed, I propose to forward this
list, separately, as soon as I can.

17th September, 1914.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
MY LORD,
</p>

<p>
In continuation of my despatch of September 7th, I
have the honour to report the further progress of the
operations of the Forces under my command from
August 28th.
</p>

<p>
On that evening the retirement of the Force was
followed closely by two of the enemy's cavalry columns,
moving south-east from St. Quentin.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Saturday, August 29
</p>

<p>
The retreat in this part of the field was being covered
by the 3rd and 5th Cavalry Brigades.  South of the Somme
General Gough, with the 3rd Cavalry Brigade, threw
back the Uhlans of the Guard with considerable loss.
</p>

<p>
General Chetwode, with the 5th Cavalry Brigade,
encountered the eastern column near Cerizy, moving
south.  The Brigade attacked and routed the column, the
leading German regiment suffering very severe
casualties and being almost broken up.
</p>

<p>
The 7th French Army Corps was now in course of
being railed up from the south to the east of Amiens.
On the 29th it nearly completed its detrainment, and the
French 6th Army got into position on my left, its right
resting on Roye.
</p>

<p>
The 5th French Army was behind the line of the
Oise between La Fère and Guise.
</p>

<p>
The pursuit of the enemy was very vigorous; some
five or six German corps were on the Somme facing the
5th Army on the Oise.  At least two corps were advancing
towards my front, and were crossing the Somme east
and west of Ham.  Three or four more German corps
were opposing the 6th French Army on my left.
</p>

<p>
This was the situation at 1 o'clock on the 29th, when
I received a visit from General Joffre at my headquarters.
</p>

<p>
I strongly represented my position to the French
Commander-in-Chief, who was most kind, cordial, and
sympathetic, as he has always been.  He told me that
he had directed the 5th French Army on the Oise to
move forward and attack the Germans on the Somme,
with a view to checking pursuit.  He also told me of the
formation of the Sixth French Army on my left flank,
composed of the 7th Army Corps, four Reserve Divisions,
and Sordêt's Corps of Cavalry.
</p>

<p>
I finally arranged with General Joffre to effect a further
short retirement towards the line Compiègne&mdash;Soissons,
promising him, however, to do my utmost to keep always
within a day's march of him.
</p>

<p>
In pursuance of this arrangement the British Forces
retired to a position a few miles north of the line
Compiègne&mdash;Soissons on the 29th.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Change of Base
</p>

<p>
The right flank of the German Army was now reaching
a point which appeared seriously to endanger my line
of communications with Havre.  I had already evacuated
Amiens, into which place a German reserve division was
reported to have moved.
</p>

<p>
Orders were given to change the base to St. Nazaire,
and establish an advance base at Le Mans.  This operation
was well carried out by the Inspector-General of
Communications.
</p>

<p>
In spite of a severe defeat inflicted upon the Guard
10th and Guard Reserve Corps of the German Army
by the 1st and 3rd French Corps on the right of the
5th Army, it was not part of General Joffre's plan to
pursue this advantage, and a general retirement on
to the line of the Marne was ordered, to which the French
forces in the more eastern theatre were directed to
conform.
</p>

<p>
A new Army (the 9th) had been formed from three
corps in the south by General Joffre, and moved into
the space between the right of the 5th and left of the
4th Armies.
</p>

<p>
Whilst closely adhering to his strategic conception to
draw the enemy on at all points until a favourable
situation was created from which to assume the offensive,
General Joffre found it necessary to modify from day
to day the methods by which he sought to attain this
object, owing to the development of the enemy's plans
and changes in the general situation.
</p>

<p>
In conformity with the movements of the French
Forces, my retirement continued practically from day to
day.  Although we were not severely pressed by the
enemy, rearguard actions took place continually.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
South of Compiègne
</p>

<p>
On the 1st September, when retiring from the thickly
wooded country to the south of Compiègne, the 1st Cavalry
Brigade was overtaken by some German cavalry.  They
momentarily lost a Horse Artillery battery, and several
officers and men were killed and wounded.  With the
help, however, of some detachments from the 3rd Corps
operating on their left, they not only recovered their
own guns, but succeeded in capturing twelve of the
enemy's.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, to the eastward, the 1st Corps, retiring
south, also got into some very difficult forest country,
and a somewhat severe rearguard action ensued at
Villers-Cotterets, in which the 4th Guards Brigade suffered
considerably.
</p>

<p>
On September 3rd the British Forces were in position
south of the Marne between Lagny and Signy-Signets.
Up to this time I had been requested by General Joffre
to defend the passages of the river as long as possible, and
to blow up the bridges in my front.  After I had made
the necessary dispositions, and the destruction of the
bridges had been effected, I was asked by the French
Commander-in-Chief to continue my retirement to a
point some 12 miles in rear of the position I then occupied,
with a view to taking up a second position behind
the Seine.  This retirement was duly carried out.  In
the meantime the enemy had thrown bridges and crossed
the Marne in considerable force, and was threatening the
Allies all along the line of the British Forces and the 5th
and 9th French Armies.  Consequently several small
outpost actions took place.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
Saturday, September 5
</p>

<p>
On Saturday, September 5th, I met the French
Commander-in-Chief at his request, and he informed me of
his intention to take the offensive forthwith, as he
considered conditions were very favourable to success.
</p>

<p>
General Joffre announced to me his intention of
wheeling up the left flank of the 6th Army, pivoting on
the Marne and directing it to move on the Ourcq; cross
and attack the flank of the 1st German Army, which was
then moving in a south-easterly direction east of that
river.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
The Advance
</p>

<p>
He requested me to effect a change of front to my
right&mdash;my left resting on the Marne, and my right on
the 5th Army&mdash;to fill the gap between that army and
the 6th.  I was then to advance against the enemy in
my front and join in the general offensive movement.
</p>

<p>
These combined movements practically commenced on
Sunday, September 6th, at sunrise; and on that day it
may be said that a great battle opened on a front
extending from Ermenonville, which was just in front of the
left flank of the 6th French Army, through Lizy on the
Marne, Mauperthuis, which was about the British centre
Courtecon, which was the left of the 5th French Army;
to Esternay and Charleville, the left of the 9th Army
under General Foch, and so along the front of the 9th,
4th and 3rd French Armies to a point north of the fortress
of Verdun.
</p>

<p>
This battle, in so far as the 6th French Army, the
British Army, the 5th French Army, and the 9th French
Army were concerned, may be said to have concluded on
the evening of September 10th, by which time the
Germans had been driven back to the line Soissons&mdash;Reims,
with a loss of thousands of prisoners, many guns, and
enormous masses of transport.
</p>

<p>
About the 3rd September the enemy appears to have
changed his plans and to have determined to stop his
advance South direct upon Paris; for on the 4th
September air reconnaissances showed that his main columns
were moving in a south-easterly direction generally east
of a line drawn through Nanteuil and Lizy on the Ourcq.
On the 5th September several of these columns were
observed to have crossed the Marne; whilst German
troops, which were observed moving south-east up the
left bank of the Ourcq on the 4th, were now reported to
be halted and facing that river.  Heads of the enemy's
columns were seen crossing at Changis, La Ferté, Nogent,
Château Thierry, and Mezy.
</p>

<p>
Considerable German columns of all arms were seen
to be converging on Montmirail, whilst before sunset
large bivouacs of the enemy were located in the
neighbourhood of Coulommiers, south of Rebais, La
Ferté-Gauchér, and Dagny.
</p>

<p>
I should conceive it to have been about noon on the
6th September, after the British Forces had changed
their front to the right and occupied the line Jouy-Le
Chatel&mdash;Faremoutiers&mdash;Villeneuve La Comte, and the
advance of the 6th French Army north of the Marne
towards the Ourcq became apparent, that the enemy
realised the powerful threat that was being made against
the flank of his columns moving south-east, and began the
great retreat which opened the battle above referred to.

</p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Issued to the Troops under his command by the General<br />
Officer Commanding the Second Corps.</i>
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As it is improbable the troops of the 2nd Army Corps
understand the operations of the last few days,
commencing on the 21st instant with the advance to the line
of the Mons Canal and ending with a retirement to our
present position on the River Oise about Noyon, the
Commander of the Corps desires to let troops know that
the object was to delay the advance of a far superior force
of the enemy to enable our Allies to conduct operations
elsewhere.  This object, owing to the skilful handling of
the Commanders of units and the magnificent fighting
spirit shown by all ranks against overwhelming odds, and
in spite of very heavy casualties, was achieved, and the
French Army is now reported to be advancing.
</p>

<p>
That the losses were not greater in the retirement
from the Hancourt&mdash;Caudry&mdash;Beaumont&mdash;Le Cateau
position on the 26th instant is due largely to the support
given by French troops, chiefly General Sordêt's Cavalry
Corps, operating on the West flank of the British troops,
and we may well be thankful to our gallant comrades in
arms.
</p>

<p>
General Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien, whilst regretting
the terribly heavy casualties and the weary forced marches,
in which it has been impossible to distribute the necessary
amount of food, begs to thank all ranks and to express his
admiration of the grand fighting and determined spirit
shown by all ranks, and his pride in being allowed to
command such a splendid force.
</p>

<p>
He is sure that whenever it is thought necessary to
again assume the offensive the troops will be as pleased
as he will himself.
</p>

<p>
The following messages have been received from the
Commander-in-Chief, Field-Marshal Sir John French, to

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
